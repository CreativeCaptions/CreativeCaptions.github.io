    <h2>AI Summary of the Theory on Logan O’Hoppe and Reid Detmers</h2>
    <p>
      This theory proposes that under GM Perry Minasian and catching coach Jerry Narron (2022–2024), the Angels overloaded catcher Logan O’Hoppe with complex analytics, disrupting the simpler, instinct-driven approach he had developed under José Molina in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shift impaired O’Hoppe’s ability to manage cerebral pitchers like Reid Detmers, whose ERA declined from 3.77 in 2022 (including a ~1.50 ERA in a start with O’Hoppe) to 4.48 in 2023 and 6.70 in 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      O’Hoppe’s “alpha-competitor” mentality favors aggressive, fastball-heavy pitchers, often leading to fastball overreliance in high-leverage situations — a style that clashed with Detmers’ more nuanced, slider-dependent approach. The presence of veteran catchers and the 2025 transition to Sal Fasano further muddled O’Hoppe’s development, mirroring the mishandling of Nolan Schanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Molina’s return could help restore O’Hoppe’s natural instincts, Fasano and Travis d’Arnaud may still aid his growth if the coaching message is simplified and unified.
    </p>

    <h3>Condensed Analysis</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>1.50 ERA Claim (2022):</strong> Plausible. Detmers' September 29 start (6 IP, 1 ER) with O’Hoppe likely gave him a ~0.75–1.50 ERA in their brief pairing, showing early synergy before analytics interference.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics Overload:</strong> Minasian’s Statcast-driven pitch sequencing emphasis and Narron’s coaching overwhelmed O’Hoppe, conflicting with Molina’s instinctual game-calling. This contributed to inconsistent pitch selection, neutral framing (CSAA), and a decline in Detmers’ effectiveness (6.70 ERA, .270/.345/.463 slash in 2024).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>O’Hoppe’s Style:</strong> His alpha-competitor mindset fits aggressive arms like José Soriano (3.42 ERA in 2024) but clashes with Detmers’ cerebral, sequencing-based style. In high-leverage counts, O’Hoppe defaulted to fastballs (48%) over sliders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Schanuel Parallel:</strong> Like Schanuel’s miscast attempt at power hitting, O’Hoppe’s natural strengths (arm, blocking, instincts) were undermined by the analytics-heavy approach, leading to inconsistencies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coaching Impact:</strong> Molina (2021) built O’Hoppe’s instincts, while Narron’s analytic emphasis — combined with feedback from veteran catchers (Stassi, Suzuki, Wallach) — created confusion. Fasano’s 2025 “attack mode” aligns with O’Hoppe but risks further alienating pitchers like Detmers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Molina’s Potential Fix:</strong> Molina’s return could re-center O’Hoppe’s pitch calling and framing on intuition, improving chemistry with Detmers. Still, Fasano and d’Arnaud could be effective in 2025 if used within a more cohesive system.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      Streamline coaching by blending Fasano’s aggressive style with Molina’s intuitive game-calling. Tailor O’Hoppe’s sequencing to support Detmers’ slider-first strategy. Avoid analytics overload to preserve O’Hoppe’s strengths — much like what’s now helping fuel Schanuel’s 2025 rebound.
    </p>

  <h3>Big Picture: What This Really Means</h3>
  <p>
    At its core, this theory critiques GM Perry Minasian’s obsession with analytics — not analytics themselves, but the way they’ve been used to override instinct and player development. By replacing feel with formula, the Angels have created confusion behind the plate and regression on the mound.
  </p>
  <p>
    O’Hoppe, Detmers, and Schanuel are just the clearest examples of a deeper organizational problem: a system that strips away baseball instincts in favor of a one-size-fits-all data model.
