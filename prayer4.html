        <h2> Prayer for Leaders and Nations </h2> 

  

        <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p> 

  

        <p> Thank You for salvation through Jesus (Yeshua) Christ, our one Mediator. Your desire is for all to be saved and know the truth, and we lift them up to You. </p> 

<p> I pray for all people, especially those in authority. Grant them wisdom to govern justly, lead with integrity, and promote peace, so we may live quiet, godly lives. </p> 

<p> Strengthen those who seek You, Father (Avinu), that they may walk in faithfulness: </p> 

        <ul> 

    <li> God Almighty (El Shaddai), give them strength to stand firm. </li> 

    <li> The God Who Sees (El Roi), open their eyes to Your presence. </li> 

<li> The Lord Who Provides (Yahweh Jireh), supply their needs to bless others. </li> 

    <li> The Lord of Peace (Yahweh Shalom), fill them with Your perfect peace. </li> 

<li> The Lord Our Righteousness (Yahweh Tzidkenu), may their lives reflect Your righteousness. </li> 

</ul> 

  

  

        <p> May all nations come to know You, Father, and proclaim Your truth to the ends of the earth. </p> 

  

        <p><strong>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</strong></p>
