    <h1>Who Turned Their Back First?</h1>
    <p>You may say you don’t want to follow the God of the Holy Bible because you don’t want to “turn your back” on the gods or traditions your ancestors followed. You don’t want to be seen as a “turncoat.”</p>
    <p>But according to the Holy Scriptures, the genealogy from Adam to Noah’s son Shem (who was on the Ark) shows something important:</p>

    <p>Noah, a direct descendant of Adam and a believer in the God of the Holy Bible, was chosen by God to survive the Flood. He, along with his sons, including Shem, were on the Ark — preserved by <strong>the one true God</strong>.</p>
    <p>The Flood happened in the year 1656 from creation. Shem lived another 502 years after the Flood. That means for over <strong>500 years after the Flood</strong>, people still had direct access to someone who had known Noah and the God of the Bible — someone who had lived through the judgment of God.</p>
    <p>So if your ancestors worshiped false gods, that doesn’t mean they were always doing so. The first generations after the Flood knew the true God — <strong>but someone, somewhere along the line, turned their back first</strong>.</p>
    <p>If Shem, who walked faithfully before God, had descendants who later turned to other gods, then the real “turncoats” were not the ones who returned to God — they were the ones who abandoned Him.</p>
    <p>So before you say, “I won’t follow the God of the Bible because my ancestors didn’t,” ask:</p>
    <h2><em>Who turned their back first?</em></h2>
    <p>Don’t turn your back on the God your earliest ancestors followed and worshiped — <strong>the God of the Holy Bible</strong>.</p>
