  <h1>The A.I. Murder Mystery Series</h1>
  <h2>Mystery: James “Jim” Shore, the Orange County Consultant</h2>

  <h3>Setting</h3>
  <p>Jim lives in Brea, California, a suburban pocket of Orange County with a small-town heart amid its landscape. The case unfolds in Dana Point during the Festival of Whales—marinas, whale-watching tours, and festival energy filling the coastal air. It kicks off on a Tuesday morning, a low tide in the festival week, rooted in a real weekday rhythm, timeless with no set dates.</p>

  <h3>Main Character</h3>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> James “Jim” Shore</p>
  <p><strong>Background:</strong> A 45-year-old software engineering whiz freelancing as a consultant, building custom apps for local businesses. He’s also an amateur sleuth, tapped by the Orange County Sheriff’s Department for tricky cases after solving a local theft with his sharp mind. Nicknamed “Jim” as a kid for being a Star Trek fan. His faith-driven moral compass pushes him to chase truth. He’s crafted a custom, secure phone with a software assistant called COMPUTER.</p>
  <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, medium build, sandy blonde hair, blue eyes, clean-shaven. He wears blue jeans, casual button-ups, and a light windbreaker—ready for Dana Point’s coastal chill.</p>
  <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Jim’s approachable, unassuming, and principled, with a knack for piercing questions and dry humor. He leans on COMPUTER like a trusty sidekick, riffing ideas as he unpicks clues.</p>
  <p><strong>Family Life:</strong> Jim’s anchored by Lisa, his wife, a freelance graphic designer working from their cozy Brea home. They’ve got a 12-year-old son, John, an Angels baseball fan, and a 9-year-old daughter, Jennifer, hooked on science fairs.</p>
  <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Jim’s meticulous streak can sidetrack him, caught up in clues no one else notices—his detective pals rib him.</p>

  <h3>COMPUTER (The Software)</h3>
  <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> On his secure phone runs an A.I. he wrote, named "COMPUTER"—analyzing physical clues (objects, handwriting, timestamps) and cross-referencing public data (festival schedules, general info), all based on Jim and COMPUTER’s deductions, with no private or government access.</p>
  <p><strong>Example Interaction:</strong> Jim says, “COMPUTER, analyze this wristband.” It replies, “Analysis complete. Wristband design matches the Festival of Whales VIP passes. Date stamp indicates use yesterday. The name ‘Carl’ is written in permanent marker, consistent with festival guest markings.”</p>
  <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Pure logic, no gut—Jim bridges that gap.</p>

  <h3>Supporting Character (Police Contact)</h3>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Detective Mark Reynolds</p>
  <p><strong>Background:</strong> A 46-year-old detective with the Orange County Sheriff’s Department in Santa Ana. Friends with Jim since childhood in Brea. They bonded over Star Trek, went to Cal State Fullerton together, and are now barbecue mates. Mark’s married with three kids and recruited Jim for consulting after seeing his knack.</p>
  <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Tall, stocky, dark hair, clean-shaven, in slacks and a button-up, no tie.</p>
  <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Mark’s steady and supportive, offsetting Jim’s precision with easygoing calm. He trusts Jim’s hunches, saying, “You’re my go-to in a pinch, Jim.”</p>
  <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Mark’s relaxed approach can overlook the finer points Jim tends to catch.</p>

  <h3>Plot Setup (The Dana Point Case)</h3>
  <p>Mark calls Jim about a Tuesday murder in Dana Point during the Festival of Whales. Tom Harper, a yacht broker and small-time hustler, is found stabbed on his yacht with a kitchen knife—premeditated, not a boat find. A stray wristband near the body—a VIP pass stamped for Monday with “Carl” scrawled on it—sparks Jim’s curiosity. COMPUTER links it to the festival, pointing to Carl Bennett, a whale-watching tour operator with a beef against Harper. But there’s more to dig up.</p>

  <h2>Chapter One: The Whale’s Shadow</h2>
  <p>James “Jim” Shore stood in his Brea kitchen, flipping pancakes on a Tuesday morning. His wife, Lisa, grabbed her laptop bag for a client meeting. “Don’t forget the milk,” Lisa said, kissing his cheek before heading out. The phone buzzed as Jim slid a pancake onto John’s plate. Detective Mark Reynolds’ voice came through: “Hey, Jim, got a case in Dana Point I could use you on. You free?”</p>

  <p>Jim drove down the 57 Freeway. Ocean air hit him as he pulled into Dana Point’s marina. He tugged his windbreaker over his button-up and jeans, his 6-foot, 200-pound frame blending into the Festival of Whales crowd. Kids waved whale balloons, vendors sold clam chowder, and a humpback float rolled by. Mark met him on Tom Harper’s yacht deck. “Good to see you, Jim.” Harper’s body lay sprawled, a kitchen knife in his chest—brought by the killer, not from the boat.</p>

  <p>Mark handed Jim a crumpled note from Harper’s pocket. “Yacht broker. Bit of a wheeler-dealer,” he said. “Mentions a captain’s log sale. Figured you’d catch something I didn’t.” A festival worker nearby grumbled, “These VIP passes are a mess—half the staff don’t even check ‘em.”</p>

  <p>Jim scanned the deck. His blue eyes snagged on a blue festival wristband half-tucked under a rope. “Carl” was scrawled on it in marker, with a Monday date stamp. He picked it up. “COMPUTER, analyze this wristband,” he said, snapping a pic with his custom phone.</p>

  <p>A calm voice replied, “Analysis complete. Wristband design matches the Festival of Whales VIP passes. Date stamp indicates use yesterday. The name ‘Carl’ is written in permanent marker, consistent with festival guest markings.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned. “This wristband’s from yesterday, Mark,” he said. “And it’s got a name—Carl. Whoever he is, he was here before Harper died. That’s no accident.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded. “Nice one, Jim. Let’s track down this Carl—maybe he’s still at the festival.”</p>

  <p>Jim smirked. “With a VIP pass, he’s probably not slumming it. Let’s hit the festival booths.” He glanced at the captain’s log note. This was just the start, and Jim Prime was ready to dig in with his oldest friend.</p>
