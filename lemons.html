    <h1 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">The Lemon Trade</h1>
    
    <p>Once upon a modern time, in a suburb just past the edge of common sense, a well-meaning group of friends threw a surprise party for a man named Eli Everafter—who had the uncanny ability to accept life’s curveballs like they were confetti.</p>

    <p>He smiled graciously as he unwrapped his gifts: box after box of lemons.</p>

    <p>“Full of vitamin C!” said one friend.</p>
    <p>“They’re organic!” said another.</p>
    <p>“It’s symbolic,” added a third. “You know—make lemonade!”</p>

    <p>Eli nodded thoughtfully, packed the lemons into a reusable tote bag, and excused himself with the polite calm of someone who’d just received too much advice in citrus form.</p>

    <p>He wandered down a dusty lane until he came across a crooked sign that read:</p>

    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; margin: 1em 0; padding-left: 1em;">
      “Watermelons & Lemonade – No Refunds. No Complaints.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Behind the stand stood a sun-hatted farmer named Miles McGrath, a watermelon farmer with a lemonade stand.</p>

    <p>Eli raised his tote. “Lemons. Lots of ’em. Any interest?”</p>

    <p>Miles eyed the bag, then him, then the horizon. “Depends. Are they just lemons, or do they come with backstory?”</p>

    <p>“Mostly disappointment," Eli said. “But well-packaged.”</p>

    <p>He grinned. “That’ll do.”</p>

    <p>With a firm handshake and no small sense of satisfaction, they made the trade. He walked away with a giant, juicy watermelon—cooler than anything life had handed him in a while.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2em; text-align: left;">Moral of the story:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      “When life gives you lemons, find a watermelon farmer with a lemonade stand.”
    </p>
