  <h2>America Can End Homelessness for Everyone 62+ in Five Years</h2>
  <p>A focused, five-year federal program to give seniors stable homes, dignity, and community.</p>
</header>

  <section>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p><strong>620,000+</strong> Americans aged <strong>62+</strong> are homeless or one crisis from the street.</p>

    <p><strong>Ages 62–64 are the danger zone:</strong> too young for Medicare; one medical bill can wipe out housing, savings, and health coverage all at once.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Too many seniors are invisible — living in cars, shelters, or doubled-up with unstable families.</li>
      <li>One crisis (medical, repair, or unexpected bill) often triggers a lifetime of instability.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>America moves fast when it decides to</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Built <strong>300,000 aircraft</strong> in four years (WWII)</li>
      <li>Constructed a <strong>42,000-mile</strong> Interstate Highway System in one generation</li>
      <li>Sent men to the moon in under ten years</li>
      <li>Created, manufactured, and distributed COVID vaccines in under a year (Operation Warp Speed)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Housing 620,000 seniors is trivial compared to any of those.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p><strong>One five-year program.</strong> Estimated total cost: <em>$56–68 billion</em>.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>The American Senior Homes Act — “Dignity Villages”</h3>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>The National Leadership Pledge (annually until complete)</strong><ul>
    <li>Contributors commit the equivalent of a <strong>1% annual wealth stewardship pledge</strong>.</li>
    <li>The pledge can be fulfilled by:
      <ul>
        <li>Paying it as a surcharge to the IRS, or</li>
        <li>Directing the same amount — with a <strong>100% tax credit</strong> — to the National Senior Housing Trust.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Naming Rights for Innovation:</strong> Contributors receive long-term naming and branding rights for the communities they fund, inspiring excellence in design, innovation, and maintenance.</li>
  </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Real homes in real neighborhoods (50/50 split)</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Rehab vacant, abandoned, and blighted properties in existing towns and cities.</li>
            <li>Quick-build 400–600 sq ft accessible units on those sites and on under-used federal land inside real communities — no remote camps.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Lifetime lock</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Rent + utilities + tax capped at <strong>$500/month</strong>, sliding down to $0 as needed.</li>
            <li>Homes stay in the program forever — no resale, no inheritance, no flipping.</li>
              <li>Residents are safe for life.</li>
            <li>No work tests. Seniors have already done their part.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </article>

    <h2>The Math</h2>
    <p>The top <strong>100 billionaires</strong> could fund the entire program with a single <strong>1%</strong> of their net worth and still remain richer than 99.999% of humanity the next morning.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Upside</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebuilt neighborhoods</li>
      <li>Safer, more stable streets</li>
      <li>A strengthened local tax base</li>
      <li>Zero new taxes on the middle class</li>
      <li>Zero hidden elderly</li>
      <li>Jobs for those building and maintaining them</li>
      <li>Technology and services grow to support communities</li>
    </ul>

      <p><strong>We pulled off Warp Speed in months. We can give our parents and grandparents a front door in five.</strong></p>

    <h2>Call to action</h2>
    <p>Let America’s wealthiest lead the way — strengthening the country that gave their earliest ideas, risks, and companies a home.</p>
    <p>Create the legacy leaderboard. Let them inspire each other. Let them lead.</p>

    <p><strong>Five years. Done. Dignity restored. And America remembers how to finish what it starts.</strong></p>
