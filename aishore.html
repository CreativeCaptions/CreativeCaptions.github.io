  <h1>The A.I. Murder Mystery Series: The Code of the Whale Festival</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1: The Whale’s Shadow</h2>

  <p>James “Jim” Shore stood in his Brea kitchen, flipping pancakes on a Tuesday morning. The smell of syrup filled the cozy space, sunlight streaming through the window. His wife, Lisa, named after The Mona Lisa by her art-loving parents, grabbed her laptop bag for a client meeting. Her graphic design work kept their home humming. Their 12-year-old son, Tim, an avid Angels fan, was named after Tim Salmon, Jim’s childhood favorite Angels player. Tim’s own favorite was Mike Trout, and together they called them Kingfish 1.0 (Salmon) and Kingfish 2.0 (Trout). Their 9-year-old daughter, Leigh, named after Leigh Nash of Sixpence None the Richer, loved science fairs and sang in the school music club. Both kids were already off to school. “Don’t forget the milk,” Lisa said, kissing Jim’s cheek before heading out.</p>

  <p>The phone buzzed as Jim stacked a pancake for himself. Detective Mark Reynolds’ voice crackled through, warm and familiar. “Hey, Jim, got a case in Dana Point I could use you on. You free?”</p>

  <p>Jim’s blue eyes sparked. A case with Mark, his oldest friend, always meant truth to chase. “On my way,” he said, grabbing his windbreaker.</p>

  <p>He drove down the 57 Freeway, ocean air hitting him as he pulled into Dana Point’s marina. The Festival of Whales was in full swing—kids waved whale balloons, vendors hawked clam chowder, and a humpback float rolled by. Jim, 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, sandy blonde hair catching the breeze, tugged his windbreaker over his button-up and jeans, blending into the crowd. His custom phone, a secure marvel he’d built with a nod to his Star Trek fandom, hummed in his pocket. COMPUTER, his AI assistant, was ready to crunch clues.</p>

  <p>Mark met him on Tom Harper’s yacht deck, flashing a warm smile that stretched back to their Brea childhood, when they’d bonded over phasers and backyard burgers. “Good to see you, Jim.” Tall and stocky, dark hair neat, Mark wore slacks and a button-up, no tie. Harper’s body lay sprawled, a kitchen knife in his chest—brought by the killer, not from the boat.</p>

  <p>Mark handed Jim a crumpled note from Harper’s pocket. “Yacht broker. Bit of a wheeler-dealer,” he said. “Mentions a captain’s log sale. Figured you’d catch something I didn’t.” A festival worker nearby muttered to a friend, “These VIP passes are a mess—half the staff don’t even check ‘em.”</p>

  <p>Jim scanned the deck, his faith-driven resolve kicking in. Something off meant a lie to uncover. His eyes snagged on a blue festival wristband half-tucked under a rope. “Carl” was scrawled on it in marker, with a Monday date stamp. He picked it up, curious. “COMPUTER, analyze this wristband,” he said, snapping a pic with his phone.</p>

  <p>A calm voice replied, “Analysis complete. Wristband design matches the Festival of Whales VIP passes. Date stamp indicates use yesterday. The name ‘Carl’ is written in permanent marker, consistent with festival guest markings.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned, his meticulous streak stirring. “This wristband’s from yesterday, Mark,” he said, holding it up. “And it’s got a name—Carl. Whoever he is, he was here before Harper died. That’s no accident.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded, trust in his eyes. “Nice one, Jim. Let’s track down this Carl—maybe he’s still at the festival.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s dry humor slipped out. “With a VIP pass, he’s probably not selling snow cones. Let’s hit the festival booths.” He glanced at the captain’s log note, mind racing. Truth always floated, and Jim was ready to dig with his oldest friend.</p>

  <h3>Moral Theme: Trust and Discernment</h3>
  <p>This chapter sets up Jim’s pursuit of truth, questioning what’s real amid festival chaos and a convenient clue. His faith guides him to test appearances, laying the mystery’s ethical foundation.</p>
