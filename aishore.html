  <h1>The A.I. Murder Mystery Series</h1>
  <h2>Mystery: James “Jim” Shore, the Orange County Consultant</h2>

  <h3>Setting</h3>
  <p>Jim lives in Brea, California, a suburban pocket of Orange County with a small-town heart amid its landscape. The case unfolds in Dana Point during the Festival of Whales—marinas, whale-watching tours, and festival energy filling the coastal air. It kicks off on a Tuesday morning, a low tide in the festival week, rooted in a real weekday rhythm, timeless with no set dates.</p>

  <h3>Main Character</h3>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> James “Jim” Shore</p>
  <p><strong>Background:</strong> A 45-year-old software engineering whiz freelancing as a consultant, building custom apps for local businesses. He’s also an amateur sleuth, tapped by the Orange County Sheriff’s Department for tricky cases after solving a local theft with his sharp mind. Nicknamed “Jim” as a kid for being a Star Trek fan. His faith-driven moral compass pushes him to chase truth. He’s crafted a custom, secure phone with a software assistant called COMPUTER.</p>
  <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, medium build, sandy blonde hair, blue eyes, clean-shaven. He wears blue jeans, casual button-ups, and a light windbreaker—ready for Dana Point’s coastal chill.</p>
  <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Jim’s approachable, unassuming, and principled, with a knack for piercing questions and dry humor. He leans on COMPUTER like a trusty sidekick, riffing ideas as he unpicks clues.</p>
  <p><strong>Family Life:</strong> Jim’s anchored by Lisa, his wife, a freelance graphic designer working from their cozy Brea home. They’ve got a 12-year-old son, John, an Angels baseball fan, and a 9-year-old daughter, Jennifer, hooked on science fairs.</p>
  <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Jim’s meticulous streak can sidetrack him, caught up in clues no one else notices—his detective pals rib him.</p>

  <h3>COMPUTER (The Software)</h3>
  <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> On his secure phone runs an A.I. he wrote, named "COMPUTER"—analyzing physical clues (objects, handwriting, timestamps) and cross-referencing public data (festival schedules, general info), all based on Jim and COMPUTER’s deductions, with no private or government access.</p>
  <p><strong>Example Interaction:</strong> Jim says, “COMPUTER, analyze this wristband.” It replies, “Analysis complete. Wristband design matches the Festival of Whales VIP passes. Date stamp indicates use yesterday. The name ‘Carl’ is written in permanent marker, consistent with festival guest markings.”</p>
  <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Pure logic, no gut—Jim bridges that gap.</p>

  <h3>Supporting Character (Police Contact)</h3>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Detective Mark Reynolds</p>
  <p><strong>Background:</strong> A 46-year-old detective with the Orange County Sheriff’s Department in Santa Ana. Friends with Jim since childhood in Brea. They bonded over Star Trek, went to Cal State Fullerton together, and are now barbecue mates. Mark’s married with three kids and recruited Jim for consulting after seeing his knack.</p>
  <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Tall, stocky, dark hair, clean-shaven, in slacks and a button-up, no tie.</p>
  <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Mark’s steady and supportive, offsetting Jim’s precision with easygoing calm. He trusts Jim’s hunches, saying, “You’re my go-to in a pinch, Jim.”</p>
  <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Mark’s relaxed approach can overlook the finer points Jim tends to catch.</p>

  <h3>Plot Setup (The Dana Point Case)</h3>
  <p>Mark calls Jim about a Tuesday murder in Dana Point during the Festival of Whales. Tom Harper, a yacht broker and small-time hustler, is found stabbed on his yacht with a kitchen knife—premeditated, not a boat find. A stray wristband near the body—a VIP pass stamped for Monday with “Carl” scrawled on it—sparks Jim’s curiosity. COMPUTER links it to the festival, pointing to Carl Bennett, a whale-watching tour operator with a beef against Harper. But there’s more to dig up.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Chapter One: The Whale’s Shadow</h2>
  <p>James “Jim” Shore stood in his Brea kitchen, flipping pancakes on a Tuesday morning. His wife, Lisa, grabbed her laptop bag for a client meeting. “Don’t forget the milk,” Lisa said, kissing his cheek before heading out. The phone buzzed as Jim slid a pancake onto John’s plate. Detective Mark Reynolds’ voice came through: “Hey, Jim, got a case in Dana Point I could use you on. You free?”</p>

  <p>Jim drove down the 57 Freeway. Ocean air hit him as he pulled into Dana Point’s marina. He tugged his windbreaker over his button-up and jeans, his 6-foot, 200-pound frame blending into the Festival of Whales crowd. Kids waved whale balloons, vendors sold clam chowder, and a humpback float rolled by. Mark met him on Tom Harper’s yacht deck. “Good to see you, Jim.” Harper’s body lay sprawled, a kitchen knife in his chest—brought by the killer, not from the boat.</p>

  <p>Mark handed Jim a crumpled note from Harper’s pocket. “Yacht broker. Bit of a wheeler-dealer,” he said. “Mentions a captain’s log sale. Figured you’d catch something I didn’t.” A festival worker nearby grumbled, “These VIP passes are a mess—half the staff don’t even check ‘em.”</p>

  <p>Jim scanned the deck. His blue eyes snagged on a blue festival wristband half-tucked under a rope. “Carl” was scrawled on it in marker, with a Monday date stamp. He picked it up. “COMPUTER, analyze this wristband,” he said, snapping a pic with his custom phone.</p>

  <p>A calm voice replied, “Analysis complete. Wristband design matches the Festival of Whales VIP passes. Date stamp indicates use yesterday. The name ‘Carl’ is written in permanent marker, consistent with festival guest markings.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned. “This wristband’s from yesterday, Mark,” he said. “And it’s got a name—Carl. Whoever he is, he was here before Harper died. That’s no accident.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded. “Nice one, Jim. Let’s track down this Carl—maybe he’s still at the festival.”</p>

  <p>Jim smirked. “With a VIP pass, he’s probably not slumming it. Let’s hit the festival booths.” He glanced at the captain’s log note. This was just the start, and Jim Prime was ready to dig in with his oldest friend.</p>
<hr>
  <h2>Chapter Two: The Clue in the Clam Shack</h2>
    <p>Jim followed Mark through the festival. A salty breeze mixed with the warm scent of clam chowder. Dana Point buzzed with midweek energy—tourists snapped pics of whale kites, kids darted between stalls, and ocean-themed music played from a stage. Jim’s windbreaker flapped as he scanned the crowd, blonde hair catching the sun. Mark pointed to a whale-watching booth with a blue awning. “That’s Carl Bennett’s spot,” he said. “Runs tours out of the marina—let’s see if he’s our Carl.”</p>

    <p>The booth hummed—people queued for tickets, a chalkboard reading “Next Tour: 1 PM.” A wiry man in his late 30s stood behind the counter, sunburned and wearing a faded captain’s hat. He barked orders to a teenage assistant. Jim clocked him—Carl Bennett, name tag confirmed. Mark flashed his badge, calm but firm. “Carl Bennett? Detective Mark Reynolds, OC Sheriff’s Department. This is Jim Shore, consultant. Got a minute?”</p>

    <p>Carl’s eyes narrowed. He waved off the teen and leaned on the counter, adjusting his hat with a twitch. “Yeah, sure. What’s this about?” His tone was rough, like he’d haggled too often.</p>

    <p>Jim held up the wristband, voice even. “Found this on Tom Harper’s yacht. Name ‘Carl’ on it, VIP pass, stamped for yesterday. Harper’s dead—stabbed this morning. Ring any bells?”</p>

    <p>Carl’s jaw tightened. He tugged his hat lower, muttering, “Harper? That sleaze? Never met him. Don’t know nothing about a yacht or a wristband. I was here all day yesterday—running tours. Check my logs.” He crossed his arms, daring them.</p>

    <p>Mark jotted a note, but Jim’s instincts flared—too quick, too defensive. He pulled out his phone. “COMPUTER, analyze public festival data for Carl Bennett yesterday.” The calm voice answered, “Processing. Cross-referencing public social media and festival uploads. Carl Bennett appears in timestamped photos at this booth from 10:14 AM to 4:37 PM yesterday, Monday. No verifiable imagery between 12:03 PM and 12:34 PM.”</p>

    <p>Jim raised an eyebrow. “Mostly tight alibi, Carl. Half-hour gap around noon. These wristbands get scattered by roving festival staff—so how’d yours end up at Harper’s murder scene?”</p>

    <p>Carl shrugged, his hat twitching again. “Beats me. I don’t mess with VIP passes—those are for the rich folks. Someone’s screwing with you.”</p>

    <p>Mark nodded, relaxed. “We’ll check those logs. Mind if we take a look?” Carl grunted and handed over a clipboard with times and names. Jim skimmed it—nothing obvious, but he wasn’t convinced.</p>

    <p>They stepped away, heading toward the food stalls. Jim’s mind churned—Carl’s denial was too pat, and that gap lingered. Then a gravelly voice cut in. “You boys asking about Harper?”</p>

    <p>Jim turned. An old-timer in a stained apron stood behind a clam shack counter, ladling chowder. His weathered face creased with a smirk. “Name’s Eddie. Been slingin’ soup here thirty years. See everything.”</p>

    <p>Mark leaned in, friendly. “What’d you see, Eddie?”</p>

    <p>Eddie wiped his hands on a rag. “Yesterday, Harper was over here, yapping loud near my booth. Arguing with that tour guy—Bennett. Something about money, I reckon. Harper ragged on Carl’s niece, too—Carl looked ready to swing, but he stormed off. Right around noon—festival was picking up.”</p>

    <p>Jim’s pulse quickened. That fit COMPUTER’s 12:03–12:34 gap. He glanced at Mark, their old rhythm clicking. “Thanks, Eddie,” Jim said, nodding. Eddie grunted and turned back to his chowder.</p>

    <p>Back in the crowd, Jim pulled Mark aside. “Carl’s hiding something. COMPUTER, dig deeper—check Harper’s public digital footprint for connections to Carl.” The phone hummed. “Analysis complete. Tom Harper used an email alias, ‘ocboatdealz@gmail.com,’ in a public yacht sale listing last week. A reply from ‘cbennett_tours@yahoo.com’ negotiated a captain’s log sale for $5,000, dated Sunday.”</p>

    <p>Mark whistled low, grinning. “That’s Carl’s business email. He lied about not knowing Harper.”</p>

    <p>Jim nodded, but his frown deepened. “Yeah, but his alibi’s mostly solid—photos pin him here, gap or not. And that wristband’s too convenient with staff tossing them around.” Truth always floats, he thought, faith firm. “This feels like a frame, Mark. Carl’s in it, but he’s not our killer.”</p>

    <p>Mark’s smile flickered with agreement, their childhood trust steady. “So who’s pulling the strings? Let’s shake Carl again—see if he cracks.”</p>

    <p>Jim smirked, humor dry. “Or we find who borrowed his name. Back to the marina—someone else was on that yacht.” His blue eyes sharpened. Time to hunt the real truth with his oldest friend.</p>
<hr>
  <h1>Chapter 3: Tides of Suspicion</h1>

  <p>The festival sprawled across the waterfront like a living thing, its pulse set by the chatter of vendors, excitement of visitors, and the distant cry of gulls. Jim stood at the edge of the boardwalk, squinting against the late morning sun glinting off the harbor. The wristband—neon green, stamped with Coastal Harvest Fest—sat heavy in his pocket, a silent accusation. Somewhere in this crowd, it had slipped from a killer’s wrist. Or been planted. He wasn’t sure which possibility gnawed at him more.</p>

  <p>Mark scanned the booths. “Place is packed. You think our guy’s here, blending in like it’s just another Saturday?”</p>

  <p>“Killers don’t usually skip town right after,” Mark said. “They stick around, act normal. Watch the chaos they caused.” He’d seen it before—too many times—in his years as a detective. Harper’s murder felt personal, not random, and the festival was the only lead they had.</p>

  <p>They moved into the crowd, the air thick with the scent of fried clams and sunscreen. Booths lined the boardwalk: artisans hawking driftwood sculptures, fishermen selling smoked salmon, a face-painting station swarmed by kids. Jim’s eyes flicked to each vendor, searching for a tell—nervous hands, a too-quick glance. The wristband suggested someone tied to the festival, but half the town had one. It wasn’t enough.</p>

  <p>“Let’s start with the whale-watching booth,” Jim said, nodding toward a blue canopy near the pier. “Harper’s business was yachts. Boats, water—it’s a connection.”</p>

  <p>Mark raised an eyebrow. “You’re reaching, but sure. Lead the way.”</p>

  <p>The booth was manned by a broad-shouldered man in his forties, his weathered face half-hidden under a captain’s hat. A sign read <strong>Bennett’s Whale Tours – Book Your Adventure!</strong> The man—Carl Bennett, Jim presumed—was chatting with a couple, gesturing animatedly toward a photo of a breaching orca. His smile was easy, practiced, but Jim caught a flicker in his eyes when they approached, like a curtain twitching shut.</p>

  <p>“Morning,” Jim said, keeping his tone neutral. “You Carl Bennett?”</p>

  <p>“That’s me.” Carl’s voice was warm, but his hands stilled on the stack of brochures he’d been straightening. “You fellas looking for a tour? Got a group going out at two—prime whale season.”</p>

  <p>“Maybe later,” Jim said. “We’re asking around about Harper Kline. Yacht broker. You know him?”</p>

  <p>Carl’s smile didn’t falter, but his fingers tightened on the brochures. “Harper? Sure, heard of him. Big name in the marina crowd. Terrible what happened.” He shook his head, the picture of sympathy. “You cops?”</p>

  <p>“Something like that,” Mark cut in, leaning casually against the booth. “You at the festival all day yesterday?”</p>

  <p>“Pretty much,” Carl said. “Set up at eight, worked the booth till close. Why?”</p>

  <p>Jim pulled the wristband from his pocket, holding it up but not handing it over. “Found this near Harper’s place. Looks like one of yours.”</p>

  <p>Carl’s eyes flicked to the wristband, then back to Jim. “Festival pass. Everyone’s got one—vendors, guests, even the kids running around with cotton candy. Doesn’t mean much.”</p>

  <p>“Maybe,” Jim said, pocketing it again. “You ever do business with Harper? Yachts, tours—any overlap?”</p>

  <p>Carl laughed, a little too loud. “Nah, different worlds. I take tourists to see whales. He sold million-dollar boats to rich folks. No reason to cross paths.” He turned to straighten a display of keychains, dismissing them without saying it.</p>

  <p>Jim nodded, letting the silence stretch. Carl’s answers were smooth, but there was a rhythm to them, like lines rehearsed. He made a mental note: Check Carl’s alibi. Dig into his business. Something about the man’s easy charm felt like a mask.</p>

  <p>“Thanks for your time,” Jim said, stepping back. “We’ll be in touch.”</p>

  <p>As they walked away, Mark muttered, “He’s hiding something. You see how he gripped those brochures?”</p>

  <p>“Yep,” Jim said. “But he’s not the only one here with secrets. Let’s keep moving.”</p>

  <p>They spent the next hour working the festival, questioning vendors. A jewelry maker remembered Harper arguing with someone near the beer tent the night before his death—couldn’t say who. A food truck owner mentioned Carl’s booth had been unmanned for a stretch yesterday evening, though he couldn’t pin the time. Small pieces, nothing solid, but Jim felt the puzzle starting to take shape.</p>

  <p>By noon, they paused near the harbor’s edge, the water lapping at the pilings below. Mark pulled out his phone, scrolling through notes. “So, Carl’s cagey, and Harper was stirring up trouble. What’s next?”</p>

  <p>Jim’s gaze drifted to a stack of festival flyers on a nearby table, one advertising Bennett’s Whale Tours. Tucked beneath it, half-hidden, was a folded piece of paper that didn’t match the rest. He stepped over, casual, and slipped it into his hand. Unfolding it, he found a handwritten note: Log sold. Meet at pier, 10 p.m. No names, no date, but the word log hit him like a cold wave. Harper’s business wasn’t just yachts—it was records, deals, maybe even fakes. A captain’s log scam could tie it all together.</p>

  <p>“Mark,” Jim said, holding up the note. “We’ve got something.”</p>

  <p>Mark leaned in, reading it over his shoulder. “Pier, ten. That’s a start. You think it’s Carl?”</p>

  <p>“Could be,” Jim said, folding the note carefully. “Or someone he’s working with. Either way, this festival’s got more than fried clams to offer.”</p>

  <p>The sun climbed higher, and the crowd thickened. Jim felt the weight of the case settling in—Harper’s death, the wristband, now this note. The killer was close, maybe watching them right now. He scanned the faces around them, wondering which one hid the truth.</p>
<hr>
  <h2>Chapter 4: Hunt the Woman</h2>

  <p>The Dana Point marina hummed under a gray Tuesday afternoon sky, the Festival of Whales still bustling despite the morning’s low tide. Jim Shore stood in the Orange County Sheriff’s makeshift command post—a cramped trailer parked near the harbor’s edge—his sandy blonde hair catching the dim light from a flickering bulb. Mark Reynolds slouched in a folding chair, scrolling through grainy festival footage on a laptop. The air smelled of stale coffee and saltwater, and Jim’s windbreaker rustled as he leaned over Mark’s shoulder, blue eyes narrowing at the screen.</p>

  <p>“COMPUTER, enhance sector three, timestamp 8:47 p.m. Monday,” Jim said, holding his custom phone. The calm, synthetic voice replied, “Processing. Enhancing footage from festival security camera, northwest yacht dock.”</p>

  <p>The screen sharpened, revealing a dark-haired woman weaving through a crowd near Tom Harper’s yacht. She wore a sleek navy coat, her face half-turned from the camera, but a scarf trailed from her shoulder bag—silk, with a faint shimmer. COMPUTER zoomed in unprompted, highlighting a monogram stitched in gold thread: E.L. “Pattern analysis suggests a custom design, not festival merchandise,” COMPUTER noted. “Cross-referencing yacht dock activity: the woman appears at 8:46 p.m., departs 8:50 p.m.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s instincts sharpened. “That’s three hours before Harper’s estimated time of death,” he said, glancing at Mark. “She’s no tourist. Look—her hand’s brushing Harper’s jacket. Could be passing something.”</p>

  <p>Mark squinted, rubbing his jaw. “Or she’s just bumping into him. Crowded dock, Jim. You sure your gut’s not outrunning the evidence again?”</p>

  <p>Jim smirked, dry humor surfacing. “My gut’s kept us ahead so far, hasn’t it?” He tapped his phone. “COMPUTER, isolate any frames with that scarf design from festival uploads—public feeds only.” The AI hummed. “One match found. Social media post, Monday, 9:12 p.m., tagged near the whale-watching pier. User: ‘danapointdeals.’ Image shows the same monogrammed scarf.”</p>

  <p>Mark straightened. “Alright, that’s something. Who’s ‘danapointdeals’?”</p>

  <p>Jim’s fingers danced across his phone, pulling up the profile. “No real name, but it’s linked to yacht sales—listings for high-end boats, same market as Harper. Posts stopped cold yesterday.” He frowned, faith nudging him to dig deeper. Truth didn’t hide in coincidences. “This woman’s tied to Harper’s deals, Mark. Maybe she handed him that log note we found—or something worse.”</p>

  <p>Mark pushed back his chair, grabbing his keys. “Then let’s find her. Festival’s still open—she could be working a booth, blending in.”</p>

  <p>They stepped out into the marina, the crowd thicker now with latecomers snapping photos of a whale-shaped float. Gulls wheeled overhead, their cries mingling with a steel drum band near the food stalls. Jim scanned faces, his 6-foot frame cutting through the bustle, windbreaker flapping in the coastal breeze. The wristband—neon green, “Carl” scrawled on it—still weighed in his pocket, but the scarf felt hotter now, like a thread pulling the case tighter.</p>

  <p>“Start at the yacht brokers’ tents,” Jim said, nodding toward a row of white canopies by the water. “If she’s in Harper’s circle, someone’ll know her.”</p>

  <p>The first booth, marked Coastal Elite Yachts, was manned by a slick-haired guy in a polo shirt, rattling off specs to a sunburned couple. Jim waited, then stepped in, voice calm but firm. “Afternoon. Jim Shore, working with the Sheriff’s Department. You know a woman, dark hair, maybe mid-thirties, wears a scarf with ‘E.L.’ stitched on it?”</p>

  <p>The broker’s smile froze. “Uh, lots of folks come through. Don’t recall a scarf.” His eyes darted to a stack of business cards, fingers twitching.</p>

  <p>Mark leaned in, casual but sharp. “You sure? She’s linked to Tom Harper. Murdered yesterday. Ring any bells?”</p>

  <p>The broker swallowed, adjusting his collar. “Harper, yeah, tough news. Look, I don’t know any ‘E.L.,’ but… there’s a woman, Ellen, hangs around deals sometimes. Dark hair, sharp dresser. Works freelance, I think—connects buyers to sellers. Didn’t see her yesterday, though.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s senses tingled. Ellen. E.L. “Last name?” he asked, pen poised over a notepad.</p>

  <p>“Dunno. She’s cagey—cash deals, no paper trail.” The broker shrugged, but his voice tightened. “Try the whale tour booth. She was chatting with Carl Bennett last week.”</p>

  <p>Mark shot Jim a look—Carl again. Jim nodded, pocketing the notepad. “Thanks. We’ll be back if you remember anything else.”</p>

  <p>As they moved toward Carl’s blue-canopied booth, the sun broke through the clouds, glinting off the harbor. Jim’s mind churned. Ellen, if that was her, bridged Harper and Carl—maybe the log sale, maybe the murder. But why leave a scarf so traceable? His faith tugged at him: truth was deliberate, not careless. This felt like another piece of the frame he’d sensed around Carl.</p>

  <p>Carl Bennett was at his booth, same weathered captain’s hat, handing out brochures with a forced grin. He spotted Jim and Mark, and his shoulders stiffened. “You again,” he said, voice flat. “What now?”</p>

  <p>Jim held up his phone, showing the scarf’s image from COMPUTER’s pull. “Know a woman named Ellen? Dark hair, this scarf, seen with you last week. She’s tied to Harper’s yacht deals.”</p>

  <p>Carl’s eyes flicked to the screen, then away. “Ellen Langston? Yeah, she books tours sometimes—rich clients. Don’t know her well. Haven’t seen her since last Friday.” He crossed his arms, a bead of sweat on his brow despite the breeze.</p>

  <p>“Friday,” Mark said, skeptical. “Sure about that? Witnesses put her near Harper’s yacht Monday night.”</p>

  <p>Carl’s jaw clenched. “I was at my booth all Monday—check the photos. I don’t track every client.” He turned to a customer, dismissing them.</p>

  <p>Jim stepped back, letting silence settle. Carl’s story was fraying, but Ellen Langston was the thread to pull now. “COMPUTER,” he said softly, “search public records for Ellen Langston, Dana Point, tied to yachting or festivals.”</p>

  <p>“Processing,” COMPUTER replied. “Ellen Langston, 34, listed as a freelance maritime consultant. No criminal record. Social media shows sporadic posts at Dana Point events, last one Friday, mentioning ‘big deal closing soon.’ No matches for Monday festival attendance.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned. “She’s careful. Too careful.” He turned to Mark. “Let’s hit the security office—more footage. If Ellen’s our ‘E.L.,’ she didn’t vanish after Monday.”</p>

  <p>The festival’s security hub was a squat building by the pier, stuffed with monitors and a harried guard named Pete. Jim explained, keeping it light, and Pete pulled Monday’s tapes. The screen flickered, showing Ellen—or someone matching her—near Harper’s yacht again, 8:49 p.m. Her scarf caught the light as she handed Harper a slim envelope, her lips moving fast. Harper nodded, tucking it away before she melted into the crowd.</p>

  <p>“Freeze that,” Jim said. COMPUTER analyzed: “Envelope dimensions suggest documents or cash. No visible markings. Harper’s posture indicates familiarity—no signs of distress.”</p>

  <p>Mark whistled low. “She’s in deep. Deal gone wrong?”</p>

  <p>“Maybe,” Jim said, but doubt gnawed. The scarf, the envelope—it was too neat, like the wristband. He thought of Carl’s niece, mentioned by Eddie in the clam shack. Could Ellen tie to her? His faith urged patience—truth surfaced when you stopped chasing shadows.</p>

  <p>They left the security hub, the festival now glowing with evening lights. Jim clutched his phone, COMPUTER still crunching data. Ellen Langston wasn’t just a bystander—she was a player in Harper’s world. But was she the killer, a pawn, or something else? The marina stretched before them, waves lapping at the docks, hiding answers Jim was determined to find.</p>
