  <h1>The A.I. Murder Mystery Series: The Code of the Whale Festival</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1: The Whale’s Shadow</h2>

  <p>James “Jim” Shore stood in his Brea kitchen, flipping pancakes on a Tuesday morning. The smell of syrup filled the cozy space, sunlight streaming through the window. His wife, Lisa, named after The Mona Lisa by her art-loving parents, grabbed her laptop bag for a client meeting. Her graphic design work kept their home humming. Their 12-year-old son, Tim, an avid Angels fan, was named after Tim Salmon, Jim’s childhood favorite Angels player. Tim’s own favorite was Mike Trout, and together they called them Kingfish 1.0 (Salmon) and Kingfish 2.0 (Trout). Their 9-year-old daughter, Leigh, named after Leigh Nash of Sixpence None the Richer, loved science fairs and sang in the school music club. Both kids were already off to school. “Don’t forget the milk,” Lisa said, kissing Jim’s cheek before heading out.</p>

  <p>The phone buzzed as Jim stacked a pancake for himself. Detective Mark Reynolds’ voice crackled through, warm and familiar. “Hey, Jim, got a case in Dana Point I could use you on. You free?”</p>

  <p>Jim’s blue eyes sparked. A case with Mark, his oldest friend, always meant truth to chase. “On my way,” he said, grabbing his windbreaker.</p>

  <p>He drove down the 57 Freeway, ocean air hitting him as he pulled into Dana Point’s marina. The Festival of Whales was in full swing—kids waved whale balloons, vendors hawked clam chowder, and a humpback float rolled by. Jim, 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, sandy blonde hair catching the breeze, tugged his windbreaker over his button-up and jeans, blending into the crowd. His custom phone, a secure marvel he’d built with a nod to his Star Trek fandom, hummed in his pocket. COMPUTER, his AI assistant, was ready to crunch clues.</p>

  <p>Mark met him on Tom Harper’s yacht deck, flashing a warm smile that stretched back to their Brea childhood, when they’d bonded over phasers and backyard burgers. “Good to see you, Jim.” Tall and stocky, dark hair neat, Mark wore slacks and a button-up, no tie. Harper’s body lay sprawled, a kitchen knife in his chest—brought by the killer, not from the boat.</p>

  <p>Mark handed Jim a crumpled note from Harper’s pocket. “Yacht broker. Bit of a wheeler-dealer,” he said. “Mentions a captain’s log sale. Figured you’d catch something I didn’t.” A festival worker nearby muttered to a friend, “These VIP passes are a mess—half the staff don’t even check ‘em.”</p>

  <p>Jim scanned the deck, his faith-driven resolve kicking in. Something off meant a lie to uncover. His eyes snagged on a blue festival wristband half-tucked under a rope. “Carl” was scrawled on it in marker, with a Monday date stamp. He picked it up, curious. “COMPUTER, analyze this wristband,” he said, snapping a pic with his phone.</p>

  <p>A calm voice replied, “Analysis complete. Wristband design matches the Festival of Whales VIP passes. Date stamp indicates use yesterday. The name ‘Carl’ is written in permanent marker, consistent with festival guest markings.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned, his meticulous streak stirring. “This wristband’s from yesterday, Mark,” he said, holding it up. “And it’s got a name—Carl. Whoever he is, he was here before Harper died. That’s no accident.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded, trust in his eyes. “Nice one, Jim. Let’s track down this Carl—maybe he’s still at the festival.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s dry humor slipped out. “With a VIP pass, he’s probably not selling snow cones. Let’s hit the festival booths.” He glanced at the captain’s log note, mind racing. Truth always floated, and Jim was ready to dig with his oldest friend.</p>

  <h3>Moral Theme: Trust and Discernment</h3>
  <p>This chapter sets up Jim’s pursuit of truth, questioning what’s real amid festival chaos and a convenient clue. His faith guides him to test appearances, laying the mystery’s ethical foundation.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 2: The Clue in the Clam Shack</h2>

  <p>Jim followed Mark through the Festival of Whales, the Dana Point marina alive with midweek buzz. A salty breeze carried the warm scent of clam chowder. Tourists snapped photos of whale kites, kids darted between stalls, and ocean-themed music drifted from a stage. Jim’s windbreaker flapped as he scanned the crowd, his sandy blonde hair catching the sun. His custom phone, with COMPUTER ready to parse clues, felt reassuring in his pocket.</p>

  <p>Mark pointed to a whale-watching booth under a blue awning. “That’s Carl Bennett’s spot,” he said, voice steady. “Runs tours out of the marina—let’s see if he’s our Carl.”</p>

  <p>The booth was hopping—folks lined up for tickets, a chalkboard reading “Next Tour: 1 PM.” A wiry man in his late 30s stood behind the counter, sunburned, wearing a faded captain’s hat. He barked orders to a teenage assistant. Jim clocked him—Carl Bennett, name tag confirmed. Mark flashed his badge, calm but firm. “Carl Bennett? Detective Mark Reynolds, OC Sheriff’s Department. This is Jim Shore, consultant. Got a minute?”</p>

  <p>Carl’s eyes narrowed. He waved off the teen and leaned on the counter, adjusting his hat with a twitch. “Yeah, sure. What’s this about?” His voice was rough, like he’d haggled one too many times.</p>

  <p>Jim held up the wristband, keeping his tone even. “Found this on Tom Harper’s yacht. Name ‘Carl’ on it, VIP pass, stamped for yesterday. Harper’s dead—stabbed this morning. Ring any bells?”</p>

  <p>Carl’s jaw tightened. He tugged his hat lower, muttering, “Harper? That sleaze? Never met him. Don’t know nothing about a yacht or a wristband. I was here all day yesterday—running tours. Check my logs.” He crossed his arms, daring them.</p>

  <p>Mark jotted a note, his easygoing calm a contrast to Jim’s focus. But Jim’s instincts flared—Carl’s denial came too fast. He pulled out his phone. “COMPUTER, analyze public festival data for Carl Bennett yesterday.”</p>

  <p>The calm voice replied, “Processing. Cross-referencing public social media and festival uploads. Carl Bennett appears in timestamped photos at this booth from 10:14 AM to 4:37 PM yesterday, Monday. No verifiable imagery between 12:03 PM and 12:34 PM.”</p>

  <p>Jim raised an eyebrow. “Mostly tight alibi, Carl. Half-hour gap around noon. These wristbands get tossed around by festival staff—so how’d yours end up at Harper’s murder scene?”</p>

  <p>Carl shrugged, his hat twitching again. “Beats me. I don’t mess with VIP passes—those are for the rich folks. Someone’s messing with you.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded, relaxed. “We’ll check those logs. Mind if we take a look?” Carl grunted and handed over a clipboard with times and names. Jim skimmed it—nothing jumped out, but he wasn’t convinced.</p>

  <p>They stepped away, heading toward the food stalls. Jim’s mind churned—Carl’s story was too pat, and that gap nagged at him. Then a gravelly voice broke through. “You boys asking about Harper?”</p>

  <p>Jim turned. An old-timer in a stained apron stood behind a clam shack counter, ladling chowder. His weathered face creased with a smirk. “Name’s Eddie. Been slingin’ soup here thirty years. See everything.”</p>

  <p>Mark leaned in, friendly. “What’d you see, Eddie?”</p>

  <p>Eddie wiped his hands on a rag. “Yesterday, Harper was over here, yappin’ loud near my booth. Arguing with that tour guy—Bennett. Something about money, I reckon. Harper ragged on Carl’s niece, too—Carl looked ready to swing, but he stormed off. Right around noon—festival was picking up.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s pulse quickened. That fit COMPUTER’s 12:03–12:34 gap. He glanced at Mark, their old rhythm clicking. “Thanks, Eddie,” Jim said, nodding. Eddie grunted and turned back to his chowder.</p>

  <p>Back in the crowd, Jim pulled Mark aside. “Carl’s hiding something. COMPUTER, dig deeper—check Harper’s public digital footprint for connections to Carl.”</p>

  <p>The phone hummed. “Analysis complete. Tom Harper used an email alias, ‘ocboatdealz@gmail.com,’ in a public yacht sale listing last week. A reply from ‘cbennett_tours@yahoo.com’ negotiated a captain’s log sale for $5,000, dated Sunday.”</p>

  <p>Mark whistled low, grinning. “That’s Carl’s business email. He lied about not knowing Harper.”</p>

  <p>Jim nodded, but his frown deepened. “Yeah, but his alibi’s mostly solid—photos pin him here, gap or not. And that wristband’s too convenient with staff tossing them around.” His faith nudged him—truth didn’t hide in easy answers. “This feels like a frame, Mark. Carl’s in it, but he’s not our killer.”</p>

  <p>Mark’s smile flickered with agreement, their childhood trust steady. “So who’s pulling the strings? Let’s shake Carl again—see if he cracks.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s dry humor crept out. “Or we find who borrowed his name. Back to the marina—someone else was on that yacht.” His blue eyes sharpened, ready to hunt the real truth with his oldest friend.</p>

  <h3>Moral Theme: Integrity in Uncertainty</h3>
  <p>This chapter explores acting with honesty when clues point too neatly to one suspect. Jim’s resolve to look beyond the obvious reflects his commitment to truth, even when the trail gets murky.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3: Ripples on the Tide</h2>

  <p>Jim and Mark headed back toward the Dana Point marina, the Festival of Whales humming around them. The afternoon sun glinted off the water, sailboats bobbing in the distance. Gulls wheeled overhead, their cries mixing with the chatter of festival-goers. Jim’s windbreaker rustled as he walked, his 6-foot frame moving with purpose, sandy blonde hair catching the light. His custom phone, with COMPUTER’s logic at the ready, sat snug in his pocket. Carl Bennett’s lie about not knowing Harper burned in Jim’s mind, but the too-neat wristband clue gnawed at him—truth didn’t come wrapped so tidy.</p>

  <p>Mark, tall and stocky, kept pace, his slacks and button-up a contrast to the casual crowd. “You’re right about Carl,” he said, voice warm but thoughtful. “He’s hiding something, but that wristband feels planted. So, what’s next, Jim?”</p>

  <p>Jim’s blue eyes scanned the marina, his faith-driven resolve steady. “We need eyes on that yacht again. If someone’s framing Carl, they left tracks.” His dry humor slipped out. “Unless our killer’s a whale with a grudge.”</p>

  <p>Mark chuckled, their old Brea-born rhythm easy. “I’ll put in a call to the precinct—no whale suspects yet.”</p>

  <p>At the marina, Harper’s yacht was still cordoned off, yellow tape fluttering in the breeze. A deputy waved them through, recognizing Mark. The deck looked the same—ropes coiled, Harper’s body now gone, but the scene still vivid in Jim’s mind. He crouched near where he’d found the wristband, his meticulous streak kicking in. “COMPUTER, scan for anything out of place—public data, festival patterns, anything tied to this spot yesterday.”</p>

  <p>The calm voice hummed through his phone. “Processing. Cross-referencing marina schedules and public uploads. A festival volunteer logged a lost-and-found entry Monday at 11:47 AM: a blue scarf, found near this yacht. No claimant. No other anomalies reported.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned, standing. “A scarf? That’s odd for a warm day.” He scanned the deck, then spotted a faint snag on a railing bolt—a few blue threads, barely visible. He snapped a pic. “COMPUTER, analyze these fibers.”</p>

  <p>“Analysis complete. Fibers consistent with polyester, dyed blue, common in lightweight scarves. Trace sand particles match Dana Point beach composition.”</p>

  <p>Mark raised an eyebrow. “You’re thinking someone dropped it running from the yacht?”</p>

  <p>“Maybe,” Jim said, pocketing the phone. “Or left it to be noticed later. Let’s ask around—someone saw something.” His gut said the scarf wasn’t random, and faith taught him to chase what didn’t fit.</p>

  <p>They headed to the festival’s volunteer booth, a folding table piled with maps and whale stickers. A woman in her 50s, with a friendly smile and a “Volunteer” badge reading “Marjorie,” greeted them. “Here for tour info?” she asked, handing Jim a flyer.</p>

  <p>Mark flashed his badge, keeping it light. “Detective Mark Reynolds, OC Sheriff’s Department. This is Jim Shore, consultant. We’re checking on a lost scarf reported yesterday near the marina. You know anything about it?”</p>

  <p>Marjorie’s smile faded, but she nodded. “Oh, yes. I logged that myself. Found it by the docks, near where those fancy yachts park. Figured someone got chilly on a boat ride.” She rummaged under the table and pulled out a clear plastic bag. Inside was a blue scarf, thin and slightly frayed. “No one claimed it. Sad—looks handmade.”</p>

  <p>Jim took the bag, turning the scarf over. A faint initial was stitched in one corner: “L.” His pulse ticked up. “Mind if we hold onto this, Marjorie? Could help us out.”</p>

  <p>She waved a hand. “Go ahead. Hope it’s useful.”</p>

  <p>Back by the marina, Jim handed the scarf to Mark. “An ‘L’ could be anyone—Laura, Liam, even Lisa, though my Lisa’s safe in Brea.” His humor was dry, but his mind raced. “COMPUTER, cross-check public festival records for anyone with an ‘L’ initial tied to Harper or Carl.”</p>

  <p>“Processing,” COMPUTER replied. “Public vendor list includes one match: Lauren Tate, 34, owns Tate’s Coastal Crafts, a festival booth selling handmade goods. Social media shows her posting about scarf sales Monday morning, 10:32 AM. No direct link to Tom Harper or Carl Bennett in public data.”</p>

  <p>Mark scratched his chin. “Handmade scarves? That’s a start. Let’s find her booth.”</p>

  <p>They wove through the festival, passing a whale-painting contest and a steel drum band. Tate’s Coastal Crafts stood out—colorful scarves and trinkets draped over a table, a sign boasting “Handcrafted in Dana Point.” Lauren Tate, a wiry woman with dark hair tied back, was rearranging display racks. She looked up as they approached, her smile polite but guarded.</p>

  <p>“Lauren Tate?” Mark asked, badge out. “Detective Reynolds, OC Sheriff’s Department. This is Jim Shore. We’re looking into something from yesterday. Can we talk?”</p>

  <p>Lauren’s hands paused on a scarf. “Sure, but I’m swamped. What’s this about?”</p>

  <p>Jim held up the plastic bag. “This scarf was found near a yacht yesterday. Looks like your work. We’re wondering how it got there—connected to a case we’re working.”</p>

  <p>Lauren’s eyes flicked to the scarf, then away. “I sell dozens of those. Folks buy ‘em, lose ‘em. That’s all I know.” She busied herself with a stack of coasters, but her fingers trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>Jim’s instincts pinged—too quick, like Carl’s denial. “Fair enough,” he said, keeping his tone easy. “But this one’s got an ‘L’ stitched in. Personal touch for a customer, maybe?”</p>

  <p>Lauren shrugged, but her smile tightened. “Sometimes I add initials if they ask. I don’t keep track. Look, I was at my booth all day yesterday—ask anyone.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded, jotting it down. “Appreciate it. We’ll check around. Mind if we keep the scarf for now?”</p>

  <p>“Fine by me,” Lauren said, turning to a customer. But Jim caught her glance back at them, sharp and uneasy.</p>

  <p>As they walked away, Jim pulled Mark aside. “She’s nervous, Mark. That scarf’s no coincidence—found too close to Harper’s yacht. COMPUTER, dig into Lauren Tate’s public footprint. Anything tying her to the marina or Harper?”</p>

  <p>“Analysis complete,” COMPUTER said. “Public marina records show Tate’s Coastal Crafts rented a vendor slip near Harper’s yacht berth for festival setup, Sunday afternoon. No direct interactions with Harper in public data. Social media mentions a ‘business dispute’ with an unnamed party, posted vaguely last week.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s frown deepened. “She had access to the marina. And a dispute? That’s motive territory.” His faith urged patience—truth took time to surface. “But Carl’s still in this, too. The wristband, the scarf—someone’s tying loose ends together.”</p>

  <p>Mark grinned, trust steady. “You’re seeing strings I’d miss, Jim. Let’s circle back to the yacht logs—see who else was near Harper’s boat.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s humor flickered. “Yeah, before we’re chasing every initial in Dana Point.” His resolve hardened. Someone was weaving a web, and he’d unravel it with his oldest friend.</p>

  <h4>Moral Theme: Patience in Pursuit</h4>
  <p>This chapter highlights staying diligent when clues multiply, reflecting Jim’s faith-guided belief that truth reveals itself to those who seek it carefully, not rashly.</p>

  <h1>Chapter 4: Shadows on the Log</h1>

  <p>The Festival of Whales glowed under the late afternoon sun, Dana Point’s marina sparkling with life. Families munched on fish tacos, a juggler tossed whale-shaped pins, and waves lapped against the docks.</p>

  <p>Jim Shore walked beside Mark Reynolds, his windbreaker catching the breeze, sandy blonde hair ruffling. His custom phone, with COMPUTER’s sharp logic, weighed steady in his pocket. The scarf with Lauren Tate’s “L” and Carl Bennett’s shaky alibi churned in his mind—clues were piling up, but Jim knew truth hid in the gaps.</p>

  <p>Mark, stocky in his slacks and button-up, glanced over. “Yacht logs, huh? You think Harper’s captain’s log note points to more than Carl’s deal?” His warm tone carried their old Brea trust.</p>

  <p>Jim nodded, blue eyes narrowing. “That note mentioned a sale, but Carl’s $5,000 deal feels small for a guy like Harper. Someone else was on that yacht—or wanted us to think Carl was.” His dry humor peeked out. “Unless Harper was stabbed over bad chowder.”</p>

  <p>Mark grinned. “I’d arrest Eddie’s soup first.”</p>

  <p>They reached the marina office, a squat building with faded whale murals. Inside, a clerk named Tina, her glasses perched low, shuffled through papers. Mark flashed his badge, keeping it friendly. “Detective Mark Reynolds, OC Sheriff’s Department. This is Jim Shore, consultant. We’re looking into Tom Harper’s yacht—any chance we can see the berth logs from Sunday to yesterday?”</p>

  <p>Tina pushed her glasses up, curious but cooperative. “Harper’s yacht? Sure thing.” She pulled a binder from a shelf, flipping to the right page. “Here—berth 17, Sunday through Tuesday. Logs show who checked in at the marina gate.”</p>

  <p>Jim leaned in, scanning the list. Harper’s name appeared Sunday, with Carl Bennett logged Monday at 11:30 AM—fitting their email deal. But another name caught his eye: Lauren Tate, Sunday afternoon, 3:15 PM. “Lauren was here,” Jim murmured. “Same day as Harper, before the wristband showed up.”</p>

  <p>Mark raised an eyebrow. “Her vendor slip for the festival, maybe?”</p>

  <p>“Maybe,” Jim said, unconvinced. His meticulous streak hummed. “COMPUTER, cross-check the marina log times with public festival data for Lauren Tate and Harper.”</p>

  <p>The calm voice answered, “Processing. Public vendor records confirm Lauren Tate’s booth setup Sunday, 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, near berth 17. No public overlap with Tom Harper. Social media shows Harper at the marina bar Sunday, 3:45 PM, posting about a ‘big deal’ with no details.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned. “They were steps apart, same hour. That’s no accident.” He thanked Tina, who waved them off with a smile, and they stepped outside. The scarf, the wristband, now the logs—someone was weaving a net, and Jim’s faith urged him to untangle it carefully.</p>

  <p>“Let’s hit the marina bar,” Jim said. “Harper’s ‘big deal’ might’ve left a trace.”</p>

  <p>The bar, a weathered shack called The Salty Fin, overlooked the docks. Nets and buoys hung on the walls, and a bartender in a whale-themed apron poured drafts. Mark nodded to the guy, mid-30s with a scruffy beard. “Detective Reynolds, OC Sheriff’s Department. This is Jim Shore. You work Sunday?”</p>

  <p>The bartender, wiping a glass, nodded. “Yeah, name’s Pete. Here all weekend. What’s up?”</p>

  <p>“We’re looking into Tom Harper,” Jim said, voice steady. “Yacht broker, hung out here Sunday. Posted about a big deal. You remember him?”</p>

  <p>Pete’s face tightened, just a flicker. “Harper? Yeah, loud guy. Sunday, he was at the bar, bragging about some log sale—said it’d ‘change the game.’ Met with a woman, dark hair, maybe 30s. Didn’t catch her name. They argued, kept it low, but he left mad. She stayed, sipping wine, cool as ice.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s pulse ticked up. Lauren Tate had dark hair, was 34. “This woman—did she wear a scarf? Blue, maybe?”</p>

  <p>Pete shrugged. “Didn’t notice. She paid cash, left around 4:00 PM. That’s all I got.”</p>

  <p>Mark jotted it down, his calm balancing Jim’s focus. “Thanks, Pete. If you remember more, give me a call.” He slid over a card.</p>

  <p>Outside, Jim pulled Mark aside, the marina glinting behind them. “Lauren’s at the marina Sunday, same time as Harper’s ‘big deal.’ Now Pete’s story puts a woman like her arguing with him. She’s deeper in this than she’s letting on.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded, thoughtful. “But no scarf mention, and cash payment’s slippery. She’s careful.”</p>

  <p>“Too careful,” Jim said. “COMPUTER, dig into Harper’s public deals—anything bigger than Carl’s $5,000 log sale.”</p>

  <p>“Analysis complete,” COMPUTER replied. “Public listings show Harper brokered a yacht sale last month, $200,000 commission, to a buyer tagged ‘L.T.’ in a forum post. No full name. Buyer complained publicly about ‘missing logs’ Friday, before the festival.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s eyes sharpened. “L.T.—Lauren Tate? If she bought Harper’s yacht and got burned, that’s motive, not just a dispute.” His faith steadied him—hasty judgments clouded truth. “But the wristband still screams Carl. Someone’s playing both ends.”</p>

  <p>Mark’s grin flickered. “You’re tying knots I’d trip over, Jim. Let’s check Lauren’s booth again—push harder this time.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s humor sparked. “Yeah, before we’re swimming in scarves and wristbands.” His resolve tightened. The killer was close, and he’d find them with his oldest friend.</p>

  <h1>Chapter 5: Currents of Doubt</h1>
  
  <p>The Festival of Whales pulsed into early evening, Dana Point’s marina aglow with string lights. Families lingered at food stalls, the scent of grilled corn mingling with ocean air. A folk band strummed near the docks, their melody weaving through the crowd.</p>

  <p>Jim Shore walked with Mark Reynolds, his windbreaker zipped against the cooling breeze, sandy blonde hair faintly lit by the glow. His custom phone, with COMPUTER’s steady logic, felt like an anchor in his pocket. Lauren Tate’s marina visit and that bar argument with Harper gnawed at him, but the wristband tied to Carl still felt like a decoy. Truth, Jim knew, swam deeper than the surface.</p>

  <p>Mark, in his slacks and button-up, glanced over, his stocky frame relaxed but eyes sharp. “Lauren’s not budging easy,” he said, their Brea-born trust a quiet undercurrent. “You think she’s our ‘L.T.’ from Harper’s yacht deal?”</p>

  <p>Jim’s blue eyes flicked to the festival lights. “She fits—dark hair, marina access, motive if Harper stiffed her. But planting Carl’s wristband? That’s someone else’s move.” His dry humor surfaced. “Unless Lauren’s knitting scarves and framing tour guides.”</p>

  <p>Mark chuckled. “I’ll check her rap sheet for craft crimes.”</p>

  <p>They reached Tate’s Coastal Crafts booth, its scarves fluttering in the evening breeze. Lauren was packing up, stacking trinkets in a crate. Her dark hair was loose now, framing a tense expression. She spotted them and straightened, her smile thin. “Back again? I told you everything.”</p>

  <p>Mark kept it light, badge in hand. “Detective Reynolds, Jim Shore. Just a few more questions, Ms. Tate. Won’t take long.”</p>

  <p>Jim held up the scarf in its plastic bag, voice calm but pointed. “This was near Harper’s yacht Sunday, same time you were at the marina. You said you don’t track scarves, but ‘L’ is stitched here. We know you argued with Harper at The Salty Fin that day. Care to explain?”</p>

  <p>Lauren’s hands froze on a crate, her eyes darting to the scarf. “Argued? I don’t know what you’re talking about. I was setting up my booth Sunday, that’s it. Lots of people buy my scarves—could be anyone’s ‘L.’”</p>

  <p>Jim’s instincts pinged—her voice was too sharp, like Carl’s dodge. “COMPUTER,” he said, pulling out his phone, “pull public data on Lauren Tate’s festival activity Sunday, 3:00 to 4:00 PM.”</p>

  <p>The calm voice replied, “Processing. Public uploads show Lauren Tate at her booth, 2:17 PM, tagged in a vendor group photo. No verifiable presence from 3:12 PM to 4:08 PM. Marina bar geotag places a user, ‘LTcrafts,’ nearby at 3:50 PM, posting about ‘bad business.’”</p>

  <p>Lauren’s jaw tightened. “So I stepped away. Doesn’t mean I was with Harper. I don’t even drink at that bar—too pricey.”</p>

  <p>Mark jotted it down, his calm a steady counter to Jim’s focus. “You rented a vendor slip near Harper’s yacht, though. And we’ve got a yacht sale tied to an ‘L.T.’—big money, missing logs. Harper burned you, didn’t he?”</p>

  <p>Lauren crossed her arms, her guard up. “You’re fishing. I sell crafts, not yachts. If Harper was trouble, half this festival knew it. Ask around.” She turned away, shoving coasters into a box.</p>

  <p>Jim watched her, his faith nudging patience. She was rattled, but her denial didn’t clear her—or Carl. “Thanks, Lauren,” he said, nodding to Mark. They stepped back into the crowd, the band’s chords fading behind them.</p>

  <p>“She’s lying,” Jim said quietly, pulling Mark near a kettle corn stand. “That bar post puts her with Harper, and she’s got no alibi for the gap. But the wristband still screams setup.”</p>

  <p>Mark nodded, thoughtful. “Someone’s stirring the pot. Let’s dig into Harper’s enemies—see who else wanted him gone.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s meticulous streak kicked in. “COMPUTER, scan public forums and festival chatter for Harper’s name, anything heated from the last month.”</p>

  <p>“Analysis complete,” COMPUTER said. “Public yachting forum thread, dated two weeks ago, shows user ‘SaltySkip’—linked to Harper’s email alias—arguing with ‘WaveRider22.’ WaveRider22 accuses Harper of faking a captain’s log for a $50,000 boat deal, claims they’ll ‘settle it at the festival.’ WaveRider22’s profile ties to a Dana Point local, no name disclosed.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s pulse quickened. “Another player. Harper was juggling deals—and enemies. COMPUTER, cross-check WaveRider22’s activity with festival vendors or marina logs.”</p>

  <p>“Processing. WaveRider22 posted from an IP tied to Dana Point’s public Wi-Fi, Monday, 10:45 AM, near the marina office. No marina log match. Profile mentions ‘whale tours’ in bio.”</p>

  <p>Mark’s eyes lit up. “Whale tours? That circles back to Carl’s business—or someone close to it.”</p>

  <p>Jim frowned, the pieces shifting. “Carl’s tied to Harper by the log sale, Lauren by the yacht deal, and now this WaveRider22’s got a grudge. Someone used that wristband to point at Carl, maybe to distract from Lauren—or themselves.” His faith steadied him—truth wasn’t a tangle if you followed the light.</p>

  <p>They headed toward the marina office again, the festival’s glow fading at the edges. A young woman in a volunteer vest rushed past, dropping a stack of flyers. Jim bent to help, catching a name on her badge: Lila Morris. The “L” sparked a thought. He handed her the flyers, voice gentle. “Long day, Lila?”</p>

  <p>She smiled, flustered. “Yeah, running everywhere. Thanks.” She hurried off, but Jim filed her name away.</p>

  <p>Back at the office, Jim turned to Mark. “We’ve got too many ‘L’s—Lauren, now Lila. And WaveRider22’s still a ghost. Let’s pull Carl’s tour logs—see if anyone on his staff connects.”</p>

  <p>Mark grinned, their rhythm tight. “You’re chasing shadows, Jim, but you always find the light.”</p>

  <p>Jim’s humor flickered. “Hope so, before we’re drowning in initials.” His resolve hardened. The killer was circling, and he’d reel them in with his oldest friend.</p>
