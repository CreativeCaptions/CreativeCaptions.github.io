  <h2>Chapter 1 — Morning Light, Hidden Shadows</h2>

<p>The soft thwack of a baseball into leather echoed through the backyard as Jim Shore raised his glove, catching the ball cleanly before tossing it back underhand.</p>

<p>"Nice arm, Tim," Jim said, watching his eleven-year-old son adjust his cap and grin.</p>

<p>From the kitchen window, the laughter of Lisa and Leigh drifted out like music. Jim glanced toward the house. Leigh’s voice—bright and full of fourth-grade certainty—was explaining why star-shaped cookie cutters made everything taste better. Lisa, ever the warm center of their home, laughed softly.</p>

<p>These were the kinds of moments Jim guarded with the same quiet devotion he used when debugging code or following a faint lead in a case. Simple joys. Steady rhythms. Truth in the little things.</p>

<p>But truth had a way of turning up in unexpected places.</p>

<p>Across the coastal curve of Orange County, in the polished hush of the Laguna Belle Bungalow Resort, Maria Aguilar adjusted the collar of her housekeeping uniform and knocked twice on Suite 104. The "Do Not Disturb" sign still hung, but she'd been instructed by the front desk to check the room. The guest, a high-profile actor, hadn’t been seen all morning—and Mr. Brambleton didn’t like loose ends.</p>

<p>With a cautious push, Maria opened the door.</p>

<p>"Housekeeping..."</p>

<p>The curtains were open—sunlight poured across a sleek, minimalistic room. The bed was rumpled but untouched since the night before. And there, on the polished wood floor near the writing desk, lay Mike Solomon.</p>

<p>At first, Maria froze, unsure whether she was witnessing sleep or stagecraft. The actor’s eyes were closed, and his expression curiously calm. But the crimson stain blooming through the center of his light linen shirt made her breath hitch. A knife—elegant but horrifyingly real—was embedded deep in his chest.</p>

<p>Maria backed out of the room, hand trembling. She fumbled her phone but remembered what the training video said: Chain of command. Don’t touch anything. Notify a superior immediately.</p>

<p>Within five minutes, Gerald Brambleton, the resort’s manager of Guest Experience and Aesthetic Harmony, had arrived. He adjusted his silk cravat and peered into the room with theatrical dismay.</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” he muttered, nostrils flaring. “This simply will not do.”</p>

<p>Back in Brea, EDA pinged softly from Jim’s phone on the patio table.</p>

<p>EDA: Jim, a news alert: “Romantic series star Mike Solomon found dead in Laguna Beach resort. Authorities investigating. More to follow.”</p>

<p>Jim caught the next pitch from Tim with barely a glance.</p>

<p>His eyes narrowed—not in shock, but in the kind of focused stillness Lisa would recognize immediately. The kind that meant someone else’s chaos had just entered their quiet world.</p>

<p>Tim noticed the pause. “Dad?”</p>

<p>Jim’s voice was calm. “Just a headline, buddy.”</p>

<p>But in the back of his mind, Jim found himself wondering—<br>
Was he about to get a call from Detective Reynolds?</p>

</section>

    <section class="chapter" id="chapter-2">
  <h2>Chapter 2 — First Impressions</h2>

  <p>Jim Shore was halfway through reviewing some code modules on his back patio when his phone buzzed. He didn’t need to see the screen. The tone alone told him: Detective Mark Reynolds.</p>

<p>He answered on the first ring.</p>

<p>“Mike Solomon,” Jim said.</p>

<p>A beat of silence on the other end.</p>

<p>“You already saw the alert,” Mark replied. “Then you know why I’m calling.”</p>

<p>“Knife to the chest?”</p>

<p>“Room 104. Laguna Belle Bungalow Resort. We’re taping it off now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there in forty.”</p>

<p>“Tell them you’re with me. Full access.”</p>

<p>Jim grabbed his windbreaker and secured his custom phone into his left hand. EDA, already active, adjusted its interface to “Field Mode” as he headed straight for the car.</p>

<p>The Laguna Belle sat quietly beside the shoreline, a row of charming beachfront bungalows with white trim and shaded porches, nestled among swaying palms and ocean breeze.</p>

<p>As Jim pulled into the parking lot, a nearby uniformed officer stationed at the door recognized him before he could speak.</p>

<p>“You’re Shore? Detective Reynolds said to let you through.”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. “Thanks,” and proceeded inside without delay.</p>

<p>He was waved past the front gate and followed the path to Room 104, where yellow tape stretched across the doorway. Inside, Mark stood beside a forensic tech and gestured Jim in with a short wave.</p>

<p>“Glad you came,” Mark said. “Media’s already sniffing around.”</p>

<p>Jim stepped carefully into the room. Large windows flooded the space with light, but the energy was heavy. A body lay still on the polished floor near the writing desk—Mike Solomon, face calm, shirt soaked red at the center.</p>

<p>“Single wound,” Mark said. “Front entry, downward angle. No signs of struggle, no forced entry.”</p>

<p>Jim scanned the space, noticing a half-packed suitcase, room service menus untouched, and a balcony door cracked open just enough to let in the breeze.</p>

<p>He activated EDA by voice.</p>

<p>“EDA, begin local scene recording. Visual catalog only. No data queries.”</p>

<p><em>Understood, Jim,</em> came the smooth reply in his earpiece.</p>

<p>A polite knock at the open door turned both men’s heads.</p>

<p>Jennifer Madison, the resort’s event coordinator, stepped in, visibly composed but pale. She offered a faint smile and held up her credentials.</p>

<p>“Jennifer Madison,” she said. “Management said you might want information about Mr. Solomon’s stay.”</p>

<p>Mark nodded. “Come in.”</p>

<p>“You met him?” Jim asked.</p>

<p>“Briefly,” she said. “He requested privacy. Checked in late Thursday. Alone, as far as I know.”</p>

<p>“Anyone visit him?”</p>

<p>“Not that I saw. He mostly kept to himself.”</p>

<p>Jim watched her carefully. Her professionalism was intact, but the undertone of nerves was still there.</p>

<p>“Did he seem anxious? Preoccupied?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. “He seemed...distracted. Like his thoughts were elsewhere.”</p>

<p>She excused herself with a promise to remain available.</p>

<p>Moments later, a solid, middle-aged man entered the room with a no-nonsense handshake.</p>

<p>Gavin Trent, according to the hotel’s guest log and the embossed initials on his jacket.  
“I’m Mike’s agent,” he said, making eye contact with both men. “Booked this weekend for him. Off the radar. Now look.”</p>

<p>“We’re sorry,” Mark said. “Did he tell you why he wanted to come here?”</p>

<p>“Needed to get away from things,” Trent replied. “Fans, studio pressure. Too many women trying to claim a piece of his time.”</p>

<p>“Any enemies?”</p>

<p>“He rubbed people the wrong way, sure—but that was part of the brand.”</p>

<p>As Trent spoke, Jim let his gaze wander across the room again—this time to the writing desk.</p>

<p>There, off to the side beside a leather-bound notepad and a resort pen, sat a small solid stone turtle figurine. Polished smooth, palm-sized, and slightly speckled—like something picked up at a seaside gift shop. Simple. Unremarkable to most. But it stood out.</p>

<p>It didn’t match the hotel’s modern, curated look. The kind of thing someone brings with them, not something the hotel would provide.</p>

<p>Jim stepped closer but didn’t touch it. Just noted its presence.</p>

<p>Trent’s voice faded out as he turned to go.</p>

<p>Jim nodded politely. “Thank you, Mr. Trent. We’ll be in touch.”</p>

<section class="chapter" id="chapter-3">
  <h2>Chapter 3 — Echoes and Alibis</h2>

  <p>The drive to the stadium was swift, the streets relatively empty at this hour. Upon arrival, the area was cordoned off with police tape, and the flashing lights of patrol cars illuminated the night.</p>

  <p>Approaching the perimeter, Jim was stopped by a uniformed officer.</p>

  <p><q>I'm Jim Shore, Consultant with the Orange County Sheriff's Department,</q> he stated, presenting his credentials. <q>Detective Mark Reynolds is expecting me.</q></p>

  <p>The officer nodded, lifting the tape to allow Jim entry.</p>

  <p>Inside, the atmosphere was tense. Officers moved purposefully, gathering evidence and documenting the scene. Jim spotted Mark near the locker room entrance. The locker room buzzed with activity—flashing cameras, murmured conversations, and the rustle of evidence bags. Jim Shore stood at the threshold, taking in the scene with a practiced eye.</p>

  <p>Standing at six feet and weighing around 200 pounds, Jim's sandy blonde hair was neatly combed back, revealing piercing blue eyes that missed little. Clean-shaven and dressed in jeans, a button-up shirt, and a windbreaker, his demeanor exuded both authority and approachability.</p>

  <p>Detective Mark Reynolds approached, his presence commanding attention. Slightly taller than Jim, Mark's dark brown hair was neatly styled, complementing his deep-set hazel eyes that seemed to analyze everything they observed. Clad in a charcoal gray suit, his tie slightly loosened, Mark embodied the seasoned detective—methodical, relentless, and deeply intuitive.</p>

  <p><q>Jim, glad you’re here,</q> Mark said, gripping his hand in a firm shake. <q>It’s a mess—Rawls was found dead in the locker room. We’re treating it as a homicide. Did you bring your high-tech magnifying glass? You know, the one that talks back—EDA?</q></p>

  <p>Jim held up the EDA device. <q>Yep. Charged, calibrated, and only slightly judgmental.</q></p>

  <p>Mark smirked. <q>Perfect. Just what we need—a detective and a sassbot.</q></p>

  <p>Jim’s eyes shifted to the covered body in the center of the room. <q>Let’s see what we have here.</q></p>

  <p>Mark led him closer, lifting the edge of the sheet to reveal Gunner Rawls's lifeless face. The once-vibrant athlete now lay still, his expression frozen in surprise.</p>

  <p><q>Time of death is estimated between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m.,</q> Mark said. <q>Preliminary cause appears to be blunt force trauma to the back of the head.</q></p>

  <p>Jim took a photo of the blood and the wound where Rawls had been hit, storing it in EDA’s memory for later comparison.</p>

  <p>He nodded, scanning the room. <q>Any witnesses?</q></p>

  <p><q>Not yet. Custodial staff found him during their routine cleaning. We're reviewing security footage and interviewing team members.</q></p>

  <p>Jim's eyes settled on a nearby locker, its door slightly ajar. Inside, a baseball bat rested at an odd angle, its handle smeared with what appeared to be blood.</p>

  <p><q>Has this been processed?</q> he asked, pointing to the bat.</p>

  <p><q>Just about to. Could be our murder weapon.</q></p>

  <p>Jim took a photo of the blood on the bat.</p>

  <p><q>EDA, compare this blood sample on the bat to the one from Rawls’ head.</q></p>

  <p>EDA replied, <q>Spectral signature, viscosity pattern, and clotting rate match within 98.7% confidence. Likely same source.</q></p>

  <p>Jim raised an eyebrow. <q>That’s what I needed.</q></p>

  <p>Jim stepped back, his mind piecing together the fragments. The stadium, the timing, the victim—each element a thread in a complex tapestry.</p>

  <p><q>We'll need to delve into Rawls' relationships—teammates, rivals, anyone with a motive,</q> Jim mused.</p>

  <p>Mark nodded in agreement. <q>Agreed. Let's start compiling a list.</q></p>

  <p>As they moved to a quieter corner to strategize, the weight of the investigation settled over them. The game was over, but the real challenge had just begun.</p>

  <h3>Chapter 4 — Beneath the Surface</h3>

  <p>The stadium, once filled with cheers and conflict, now echoed with the sterile sounds of a crime scene. The locker room had been sealed off, but the hallway just beyond remained a flurry of quiet tension. Officers spoke in low tones, clipboards in hand, their shadows stretching long under the fluorescent lights.</p>

  <p>Jim stood outside the locker room, taking in the atmosphere. Mark approached.</p>

  <p>"Let’s get to work," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is the footage on its way?" Jim asked.</p>

  <p>Mark gestured toward the hallway monitors. "Already being reviewed. There are gaps, though. Cameras inside the locker rooms? Still off-limits—union rules. Closest we’ve got is from the tunnel entrance."</p>

  <p>Jim raised an eyebrow. "Convenient."</p>

  <p>Mark gave a half-smile. "Yeah. And a PR nightmare waiting to happen."</p>

  <p>They walked slowly down the hallway, glancing at locker doors, security panels, and scuff marks on the concrete floor. Jim paused near a bench.</p>

  <p>"This area," he said, pointing to a cluster of vending machines across from the visitor locker room. "Wide view. Could’ve been a good vantage point. Anyone loitering here would’ve seen who came and went."</p>

  <p>Mark took a note. "We’ll pull logs from nearby security card readers too. Though so far, nothing unusual’s popped."</p>

  <p>They continued their sweep. At the end of the hallway, a janitor was giving a statement to a patrol officer, gesturing nervously toward the locker room.</p>

  <p>Jim approached gently. "Mind if we ask a few follow-ups?"</p>

  <p>The janitor—late 40s, weary-eyed—nodded. "Sure. I just handle maintenance here. Wasn’t expecting any of this."</p>

  <p>"What time did you find the body?" Jim asked.</p>

  <p>"A little after ten-fifteen. I’d just finished up the west corridor. I opened the door and saw him on the ground. I thought he’d passed out or something."</p>

  <p>"Did you see anyone else nearby?"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. "There was someone leaving right before I got there. Maybe a player. Hoodie pulled up. Couldn’t see much."</p>

  <p>Jim and Mark exchanged a look.</p>

  <p>"Did they say anything?"</p>

  <p>The janitor shook his head. "Just walked past fast. No eye contact. Looked tense—might’ve just been post-game stress."</p>

  <p>Mark scribbled in his notepad. "Thanks. That helps."</p>

  <p>As the janitor moved on, Jim stared back toward the locker room door.</p>

  <p>"One shadow," he murmured. "Could be nothing. Could be everything."</p>

  <p>Mark nodded. "Either way, we’re not in the dugout anymore."</p>

  <h3>Chapter 5 — The Edges of Truth</h3>

  <p>The interview room inside the stadium’s administrative wing was quiet, save for the soft hum of the overhead light. Jim sat across from Cole Hastings, the Orcas’ team captain and veteran first baseman. He had a reputation as a stand-up guy—respected by teammates, fans, even rivals. But tonight, respect wasn’t enough to keep him off the list of potential suspects.</p>

  <p>Mark leaned against the wall, arms crossed, while Jim did the talking.</p>

  <p>Cole fidgeted in his seat, his hands clasped tightly in front of him. "You seriously think someone from our team did this?"</p>

  <p>"We’re not accusing anyone," Jim said calmly. "We’re just trying to understand what happened. You were one of the last to see Rawls alive."</p>

  <p>Cole looked up, his eyes a mix of anger and disbelief. "Yeah, I saw him. We all did. After that stunt he pulled, the whole team was heated. But murder? Come on."</p>

  <p>Jim leaned forward slightly. "Walk us through what happened after the game. Start from the final out."</p>

  <p>Cole sighed. "After we got the last guy out, the dugout exploded—half celebration, half fury. Rawls was smirking the whole time like he’d just pulled off the greatest prank of the century. A couple of guys shouted at him—nothing new. I went back to the locker room, changed, grabbed a protein shake, and headed out. Didn’t even see Rawls again."</p>

  <p>Mark spoke for the first time. "You left right after the game?"</p>

  <p>"About fifteen, twenty minutes after. Security had started clearing out the fans. Look, I hated what he did, but I didn’t hate him. He was a showboat. That’s not a crime."</p>

  <p>Mark scribbled a note. "Was anyone close to snapping?"</p>

  <p>"Danny Vega maybe," Cole admitted. "He’s young, emotional. He’d been working closely with our pitcher all season, helping him build toward this no-hitter. Rawls humiliated him. Humiliated us. Danny stormed out before I did."</p>

  <p>"Where’d he go?" Jim asked.</p>

  <p>"No clue. But if you’re looking for someone who took this personally… it’s probably him."</p>

  <p>Jim nodded, thanking Cole and standing up. "We’ll be in touch."</p>

  <p>As they stepped out into the hallway, Mark glanced over. "Danny Vega’s not on our cleared list. Want me to bring him in?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," Jim said. "Let’s talk to the kid."</p>

  <p>Mark paused. "You think he did it?"</p>

  <p>Jim didn’t answer right away. "I think Rawls made a career out of poking people in the chest and laughing. But sometimes… the wrong person pokes back."</p>

  <h3>Chapter 6 — The Quiet Truth</h3>

  <p>Mark and Jim stood just outside the visitors’ locker room when a deputy approached. "Detective, there’s someone here asking to speak with you. Jack Money. Says he’s Rawls’ agent."</p>

  <p>Mark sighed. "Send him in."</p>

  <p>Moments later, Jack Money strode in like he owned the building. Designer sunglasses still on. Suit too slick for a ballgame. He stopped just short of the locker room door, looking around like he was assessing property.</p>

  <p>"Detective Reynolds?" he said. "I’m Jack Money—most folks in the business call me Jack ‘More’ Money." He smiled like it was supposed to land better.</p>

  <p>Jim gave him a polite nod. "That nickname says a lot."</p>

  <p>Money ignored the jab. "This is a tragedy. Rawls was a headcase, sure, but no one deserves this. I’m here to cooperate."</p>

  <p>Mark pulled out his notepad. "When did you last speak with Rawls?"</p>

  <p>"Earlier this evening. After the game. We argued. He fired me."</p>

  <p>"Fired you?" Jim said, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Told me I was holding him back. That he didn’t care about brand value or endorsements. Said he was ‘free.’ Like he was trying to reinvent himself."</p>

  <p>Jim glanced at Mark. "Was there bad blood before tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Rawls was… difficult," Money said carefully. "But tonight was different. He embarrassed himself. That bunt? It was suicide for his image."</p>

  <p>"Did you threaten him?" Mark asked.</p>

  <p>Money gave a slow blink. "No. I told him I was out. And I left. If you check the parking lot cams, you’ll see my car pulling out. I made a call. Time-stamped. You’ll get it."</p>

  <p>Mark didn’t say anything for a moment. Then: "We will. Thanks for your time."</p>

  <p>As Money turned and strutted off, Jim shook his head. "That guy’s got snake oil in his veins."</p>

  <p>Reynolds hesitated. "You think Money did it?"</p>

  <p>"I think he had motive, timing, and a reason to disappear," Jim said. "And if Rawls really fired him minutes before he ended up dead, that’s not just a red flag—that’s a red carpet."</p>
</section>

 <section>
  <h3>Chapter 7 – Grateful Ground</h3>

  <p>Jim stood just inside the Orcas’ locker room, letting the cool air and heavy silence settle around him. A strip of yellow tape still cordoned off the row of lockers where Rawls had been found.</p>

  <p>Detective Mark Reynolds crouched next to the outline the forensics team had chalked hours earlier. "Blunt force. No defensive wounds."</p>

  <p>"Bat?" Jim asked.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Forensics confirmed it. EDA was right. Based on the bruising pattern and the angle of impact. One clean shot to the back of the head."</p>

  <p>Jim looked over at the empty bench where Rawls once sat. "So the murderer had time. No panic. No rush. Someone he trusted, maybe."</p>

  <p>Mark stood up, brushing his hands on his slacks. "We’re checking everyone who entered and exited the locker room post-game. But you know how chaotic these games get—press, friends, even family sometimes."</p>

  <p>"I think we need to talk to Money again," Jim said.</p>

  <p>Mark nodded. "Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. We can interrogate him at the OCSD."</p>
