      <h2 style="margin-top:0; font-size:1.5rem;">Personalized Prayer for God’s Love to Grow Within Me</h2>

      <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p>

      <p>Thank You for pouring Your love into my heart through the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh), as promised in Your Word. I come before You, asking that this divine love—Your agapē—would grow stronger and shine more clearly in my life.</p>

      <ul style="list-style:disc inside; margin-left:20px;">
        <li>Transform the natural love within me into a reflection of Your perfect love, so that I may love others not only when it is easy, but especially when it is difficult.</li>
        <li>Teach me to show compassion toward those who misunderstand, hurt, or oppose me, that I may mirror Your mercy and grace.</li>
        <li>Purify my heart from selfish motives and earthly reactions, replacing them with patience, kindness, and forgiveness born of Your Spirit.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Renew my soul, Father (Avinu), and let Your presence refine what is human into what is holy:</p>

      <ul style="list-style:disc inside; margin-left:20px;">
        <li>Help me see every person through the eyes of Christ (Yeshua), remembering that Your love extends to all.</li>
        <li>Increase my capacity to love beyond emotion—through obedience, humility, and trust in You.</li>
        <li>Develop within me a steady and enduring love that remains unshaken by circumstance, a love that points others toward You.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>May Your agapē become my instinct and my strength, a living testimony that You dwell within me. Let my life reveal the transformation only Your Spirit can bring.</p>

      <p><strong>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) holy name, Amen.</strong></p>
