    <h1>Personalized Prayer for Me to Follow God’s Guidance</h1>
    <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p>
    <p>Thank You for the gift of salvation through Jesus (Yeshua) Christ. I come to You asking for Your strength and guidance as I seek to follow Your will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead me by the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh) and help me to live in a way that honors You, seeking to walk according to Your purpose without the need for correction.</li>
        <li>Empower me to embrace Your discipline as an opportunity to grow and keep my heart open to Your conviction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Transform my desires, Father (Avinu),</strong> that they may align with Your purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give me spiritual eyes to see life as You do, and a heart that hungers for Your Word.</li>
        <li>Surround me with fellowship and accountability, so I am encouraged and supported in my journey with You.</li>
        <li>Guide me toward spiritual maturity, and may my decisions always reflect Your truth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>May I live each day more fully surrendered to You, trusting in Your guidance and growing in the grace You’ve given me.</p>
    <p><strong>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</strong></p>
