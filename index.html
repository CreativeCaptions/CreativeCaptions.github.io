        <h2>Personalized Prayer for Me to Follow God’s Guidance</h2>
        <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p>
        <p>Thank You for the gift of salvation through Jesus (Yeshua) Christ. I come to You asking for Your strength and guidance as I seek to follow Your will. Lead me by the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh) and help me to live in a way that honors You, seeking to walk according to Your purpose without the need for correction. Empower me to embrace Your discipline as an opportunity to grow and keep my heart open to Your conviction.</p>
        <p>Transform my desires, Father (Avinu), that they may align with Your purpose. Give me spiritual eyes to see life as You do, and a heart that hungers for Your Word. Surround me with fellowship and accountability, so I am encouraged and supported in my journey with You. Guide me toward spiritual maturity, and may my decisions always reflect Your truth.</p>
        <p>May I live each day more fully surrendered to You, trusting in Your guidance and growing in the grace You’ve given me.</p>
        <p>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</p>
