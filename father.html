    <h1>The Holy Name of God the Father</h1>

<p>Why has there been suffering throughout the ages? Is there a reason behind it?</p>

<p>Throughout history, mankind has wondered why God allows bad things to happen.
Although the answer is painful, it is because all of creation depends on it: the name of the Father must remain holy, to keep everything from descending into chaos.</p>

<p>All of Heaven was once in total harmony until the Devil led a rebellion against God, leading Jehovah (the Father) to pass judgment upon him.</p>

<p>It was Jehovah (the Father) who proclaimed the judgment. The only way for the Devil to overturn or escape this verdict is to disqualify Jehovah as worthy to pass judgment — by destroying Jehovah’s reputation and the sanctity of His name.</p>

<p>Since then, every time Jehovah declares how He will bring His creation back into harmony, the Devil immediately attempts to prove Jehovah wrong, hoping to disqualify Him.</p>

<p>Jehovah declared His creation of the Heavens and the Earth to be good; so the Devil went to work trying to destroy Jehovah’s reputation by making it bad.</p>

<p>Jehovah declared He would send One to defeat the Devil and redeem mankind; so the Devil tried to prevent this, corrupting mankind to the point Jehovah was ready to destroy all of humanity. But Jehovah found Noah worthy to continue His plan.</p>

<p>Jehovah later declared the promised One would come through Abraham, through Isaac, through Jacob (Israel), through Judah, and through David. The Devil fought against this plan as well. At one point, the descendants of Judah became so evil, they did not even realize when the Glory of the Lord departed from the first Temple — leading to the first Diaspora, and the profaning of Jehovah’s name among the nations.</p>

<p>Jehovah also declared He would sanctify His great and holy name by returning the House of Israel to their land. The Devil has continually worked to prevent this return — and continues even today.</p>

<p>But then Jehovah began to change everything. Jesus, the promised One, was born. The Devil tried to kill Him. Then he tried to tempt Jesus with the kingdoms of the Earth, but failed.</p>

<p>Jesus went to the cross for us, and although the Devil worked through human agents to crucify Him, this plan ultimately backfired.</p>

<p>While the House of Israel remained under judgment, Jehovah established the Church — first adding a remnant from Israel, then calling many from the very nations that had once mocked Him, just as He had declared through His prophets.</p>

<p>In fact, the Lord’s Prayer includes the request for Jehovah to sanctify His name on Earth as it is in Heaven.</p>

<p>Even today, many who profess to be Christians pray the Lord’s Prayer but oppose the return of the House of Israel to their land — not realizing they are actually praying for Jehovah to sanctify His name by fulfilling this very promise. If only they understood!</p>

<p>Jehovah has begun to bring the House of Israel back to the land of Israel, beginning the process of sanctifying His great and holy name, exactly as He proclaimed.</p>

<p>Eventually, the Devil will be granted authority to rule during the last 42 months of the Tribulation. He will kill the Two Witnesses and pursue the remnant of Israel as they flee to safety, where they will be protected for the final 42 months (Jacob’s Trouble).</p>

<p>The Devil will then attack the unprotected descendants of Israel and the believers who come to faith after hearing the everlasting gospel declared by an angel from Heaven at the mid-point of the Tribulation.</p>

<p>In a last desperate attempt, the Devil will try to destroy all humanity — including the protected remnant.</p>

<p>Upon failing, the Devil will be chained for a thousand years, while the Beast (the Antichrist) and the False Prophet are thrown into the Lake of Fire.</p>

<p>After the millennium, the Devil will be given one last opportunity to deceive the nations — but he will be defeated once again, and finally cast into the Lake of Fire, where the Beast, the False Prophet, Death, and Hades will also be thrown.</p>

<p>At this point, Jehovah’s reputation will have been proven holy and worthy. A new Heavens and a new Earth will be created, restoring harmony to creation.</p>

<p>Without this long journey — from rebellion, through judgment, to vindication — there could be no full restoration. Pain and suffering entered through Adam and Eve, but the resolution displays Jehovah’s perfect righteousness and holiness.</p>

<h3><strong>One Last Thought</strong></h3>

<p>When we read of the Devil (Satan) appearing before Jehovah regarding Job, we often imagine it as a normal conversation. Yet, in reality, while he stands before Jehovah, the four living creatures and all of Heaven are proclaiming, <em>“Holy, holy, holy.”</em></p>

<p>It must be unbearable for the Devil to try to speak — attempting to accuse us while being constantly reminded of Jehovah’s holiness and his own condemnation.</p>

<p>Think about that the next time you are accused by Satan.</p>

<p>He is already suffering under the glory of Jehovah’s holiness — and that should bring a smile to your face.</p>
