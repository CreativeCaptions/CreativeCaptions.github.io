     <h2>The Heavenly Prayer Pipeline: Who Does What, Step by Step  </h2>

    <p><strong>1. You Pray</strong><br>
Actor: You (the saint)<br>
Action: Raw cry, need, or intercession rises.<br>
Scripture: “The Spirit helps us in our weakness… intercedes with groanings.” (Romans 8:26)
</p>

<p><strong>2. Yeshua Receives &amp; Sanctifies</strong><br>
Actor: Jesus (High Priest)<br>
Action: Adds His incense (blood, merit, righteousness) → makes prayer acceptable.<br>
Scripture: “Another angel with a golden censer… was given much incense to offer with the prayers.” (Revelation 8:3)
</p>

<p><strong>3. Angel Places on Altar</strong><br>
Actor: Angel (ministering spirit)<br>
Action: Pours prayer + incense onto golden altar before the throne.<br>
Scripture: “The smoke of the incense, with the prayers, rose before God from the angel’s hand.” (Revelation 8:4)
</p>

<p><strong>4. God Decides &amp; Releases</strong><br>
Actor: God the Father<br>
Action: Processes the prayer according to His will → adds fire (power).<br>
Scripture: “The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it.” (Revelation 8:5)
</p>

<p><strong>5. Judgment / Answer Falls</strong><br>
Actor: Holy Spirit / Angels<br>
Action: Fire, hail, earthquake, healing, revival — whatever fits God’s purpose.<br>
Scripture: “There were peals of thunder… and 100-lb hail.” (Revelation 8:5; 16:21)
</p>

<p><strong>Key Clarifications</strong><br>
Does Jesus place it on the altar? No — an angel does. Jesus prepares it; the angel presents it.<br>
Is the angel Jesus? No. Revelation distinguishes “another angel” from “the Lamb.”<br>
Does God “process” it? Yes — He sovereignly decides when and how to answer.<br>
Is every prayer answered with hail? No. Some become healing, revival, protection, or silent grace.
</p>

<p><strong>Visual Flow</strong><br>
Your Prayer (“Help!”) → Yeshua (Adds Incense – His Blood) → Angel (Pours onto Golden Altar) → God the Father (Adds Fire – His Will) → Thrown to Earth → Answer
