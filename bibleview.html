    <h1>Biblical view of Israel, Environment, and Religion</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      When I came to Jesus (Yeshua) on <time datetime="1983-03-08">March 8, 1983</time>, at age 23, it gave me a lens for life.
      I can understand those without hope, because I once thought like them. And I can rejoice in God’s truth, because He opened
      my eyes. I know what it feels like to long for peace, and I also know the futility of rejecting God’s promises.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-2">
      I see the tension so clearly now. Since coming to faith in the God of the Holy Bible, I’ve learned to see world events through the
      lens of prophecy and His promises. But I also remember what it was like without that framework — trying to patch together my
      own ‘Nirvana’ with human solutions that could never last.

  <section id="observations" aria-labelledby="observations-heading" class="section">
  <h2 id="observations-heading">1. How people without a biblical lens often see things</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Israel:</strong> I’ve noticed that many see Israel as just another geopolitical problem. They think if Israel could be divided or
      sidelined, “peace” would follow. But they don’t see God’s covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or His plan revealed in Ezekiel and beyond.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The environment:</strong> Without believing in the Creator’s ultimate plan for the heavens and the earth, people naturally
      cling to what they <em>can</em> see. To them, this world is the only hope: “If we fix the climate, we can fix our future.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Religion:</strong> Ecumenical unity sounds attractive to many — the idea that “if only we could blend religions, we’d stop fighting.”
      But truth, by its very nature, excludes contradiction. Peace without God’s truth might sound good, but it can’t last.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

         <section id="futility" aria-labelledby="futility-heading" class="section">
    <h2 id="futility-heading">2. Why that vision is futile <small>(Romans 1; Jeremiah 17:9)</small></h2>
    <p>
      From what I’ve seen — even when people are sincere and well-meaning — their worldview leaves out the one thing that matters most:
      God’s Word. Without it, Israel looks expendable, the environment becomes ultimate, and religion is reduced to just cultural flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sin isn’t seen as the problem, so the “solutions” are always human plans, treaties, and compromises. But that leaves a dangerous
      gap — one the enemy is quick to fill. Satan offers a false peace, just like 1 Thessalonians 5:3 warns, making it look like unity
      and safety can be found apart from the cross.
    </p>

  <section id="scripture" aria-labelledby="scripture-heading" class="section">
  <h2 id="scripture-heading">3. How Scripture reframes everything</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Israel must exist:</strong> Ezekiel 36:22–25 shows Israel exists for the sake of God’s holy name, so the nations will know He is the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>God’s promise for the environment:</strong> Scripture reminds us that the Creator is in control of the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1; Psalm 24). True hope for creation comes not from human efforts alone, but from His eternal plan for redemption.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>God’s promise for religion:</strong> Lasting peace and unity are found only in knowing Jesus (John 14:6). Attempts to merge faiths apart from God’s truth cannot bring lasting reconciliation; His truth alone brings eternal peace.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


  <section id="prayer" aria-labelledby="prayer-heading" class="section">
    <h2 id="prayer-heading">My Prayer and Encouragement</h2>

    <p>
      Lord, when I see people talk about saving the Earth, I pray they would come to know You — the Creator of heaven and earth — and
      find real hope in You alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I hear talk of dividing Israel for the sake of peace, I pray they would encounter the true Prince of Peace, the only One
      who can bring lasting peace to Jerusalem (Psalm 122:6; Isaiah 9:6).
    </p>

    <p>
      And when I see the push for religious unity apart from Your truth, I pray for clarity — that people would see Yeshua as
      “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).
    </p>

    <aside class="encouragement" aria-labelledby="encouragement-heading">
      <h3 id="encouragement-heading">Encouragement for believers</h3>
      <p>
        For those who already believe, let us be encouraged: God hears these prayers. He has given us His promises, and they stand
        unshaken. Even when the world looks for peace in all the wrong places, we know where true peace is found — in Him.
