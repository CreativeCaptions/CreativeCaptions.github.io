    <h1>The Feasts of Israel, and Their Jerusalem Connections</h1>
    <p><strong>To: Nelson Walters</strong></p>

  <section>
    <p>Your YouTube video timeline, <em>“Does the Bible Reveal Month and Year of Jesus’s Return (NOT Day and Hour)”</em> is insightful, but it overlooks a key point: both the first and second comings of Jesus are rooted in Jewish context. The Gentiles were grafted in later—so the Gentile Church will be removed before the Feasts of Israel resume.</p>

    <h2>The Distinct Roles of Israel and the Church in Biblical Prophecy</h2>
    <p>The Feasts of Israel are designated for Israel, not the Gentiles. The Gentiles are grafted into the Church. The Church age concludes during the Interlude in Revelation 7:1–17, prior to the emergence of the scorpion-like creatures before the Tribulation period begins. Your timeline aligns with my long-held understanding.</p>

    <h2>Geographical Significance of the Feasts of Israel</h2>
    <p>All the Feasts of Israel are centered in the Jerusalem region, with their influence spreading outward. The original fulfillments by Jesus—Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, and Pentecost—occurred within or just outside Jerusalem. Future fulfillments also follow this pattern.</p>

    <p>At the Second Coming, Jesus will return to the Mount of Olives, just outside the city but still within the Jerusalem region. On Yom Kippur, He will enter Jerusalem to begin constructing His temple. The Festival of Booths will also occur in this region, as those in Jerusalem will see Him and turn to Him.</p>

    <p>The blessing of God through Jesus, including the healing waters for the nations from His throne—potentially linked to Hanukkah—also originates in the Jerusalem region. Thus, all events tied to the Feasts of Israel begin in the Jerusalem region and extend outward to the world and creation.</p>
