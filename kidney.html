  <h1>The Evangelist’s Kidney</h1>
  <h2>A modern-day parable</h2>

  <p>They took her kidney against her will.</p>

  <p>
    The brokers called it “supply and demand.”<br>
    The hospital called it “anonymous donor material.”<br>
    The government called it a "non-incident."<br>
    She called it theft.<br>
    But she also called it a mission field.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="she-lived">
  <h2>She Lived</h2>
  <p>They thought she might die, but she didn’t. She recovered — slowly. Her body was lighter, emptier. But her spirit was ablaze.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“They didn’t just steal part of me,” she prayed.<br>
    “They stole part of God’s temple. And God knows where it went.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>She had read the Scripture a thousand times before — “Do you not know your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?” But only now did she understand how far a temple could stretch.</p>
</section>

<section class="living-prayer">
  <h2>A Living Prayer</h2>
  <p>Each night, she laid her hand over her side, over the place where the kidney used to be, and she prayed:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Holy Spirit, as You dwell in me, and if part of this temple now dwells in someone else…<br>
    then let that part carry Your voice. Let my kidney preach. Let it convict. Let it comfort. Let it awaken the soul of whoever holds it now.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>She didn’t know their name. Didn’t know what country they were in. Didn’t know if they requested it or simply bought a lie. She didn’t care.</p>

  <p>She forgave.</p>
  <p>And then she interceded.</p>
</section>

<section class="receiver-life">
  <h2>In the Life of the Receiver</h2>
  <p>He didn’t know he had bought stolen life. Or maybe he did — but didn’t want to admit it. The organ saved him. That much was true. But something came with it. Something he couldn’t name.</p>

  <p>He started hearing things — not voices, but nudges.</p>

  <p>A sense of being watched, not by paranoia, but by grace.</p>

  <p>He found himself curious about Jesus. About forgiveness. About the concept of being “washed clean.”</p>

  <p>He didn’t even believe in God.</p>

  <p>But the kidney did.</p>
</section>

<section class="strange-connection">
  <h2>A Strange Connection</h2>
  <p>Scientists couldn’t explain it.<br>
  Doctors couldn’t detect it.<br>
  But Heaven? Heaven rejoiced.</p>

  <p>Because part of a temple, stolen and misplaced, had become a sanctuary again — not of stone, but of flesh and Spirit.</p>
</section>

<section class="temple-preached">
  <h2>The Living Temple Preached</h2>
  <p>It preached through filtration.<br>
  It preached through circulation.<br>
  It preached through dreams, through unease, through mercy.</p>

  <p>Because a daughter of God refused to let her pain rot. She turned her wound into a weapon — not of vengeance, but of Gospel love.</p>
</section>

<section class="scripture-references">
  <h2>Spiritual Truths in Play:</h2>

    <li>Romans 12:21 – “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.”</li>
