  <h2>Chapter 1: The Cheap Bunt</h2>

  <p>The sound of the television was the only sound in the living room, save for the occasional clink of ice in Jim’s glass. Jim, the father, was comfortably settled in his favorite chair, eyes fixed on the screen as the Orange County Orcas battled the Texas Outriders.</p>

  <p>Lisa, his wife, popped her head into the living room with a grin. “We’ll be back in a bit. Don’t wait up.”</p>

  <p>Jim waved them off with a smile. “Go have fun, you two.”</p>

  <p>Lisa rolled her eyes good-naturedly and followed their daughter, Leigh, out the door. Jim and their son, Tim, were left to watch the final stretch of what was shaping up to be a memorable game.</p>

  <p>The Orcas pitcher had been perfect so far, retiring all 26 batters he’d faced. Now, with two outs in the ninth, he was just one away from a perfect game.</p>

  <p>Jim’s pulse quickened as he glanced over at Tim. They both knew this was a big deal—a no-hitter in the ninth. But with Gunner Rawls, the Outriders' volatile center fielder, coming up to bat with two outs, they could sense the drama wasn’t over yet.</p>

  <p>The announcers began discussing the tension. <q>We’re two outs into the ninth inning now, folks, and the Orcas pitcher is still perfect. One more out, and it’s a perfect game!</q></p>

  <p>Jim nodded, already anticipating what was to come. Rawls was arrogant, brash, and unpredictable. If anyone was going to break up a no-hitter, it was him. And then, the moment arrived, and Rawls stepped into the batter’s box. The camera zoomed in on him as he adjusted his gloves, an impassive look on his face.</p>

  <p>Jim’s eyes narrowed as Rawls took his stance. With two outs in the ninth, it was his last chance to make an impact on the game. The crowd was already on edge. Then, in a move that shocked everyone, Rawls laid down a bunt. It was weak, barely rolling past the pitcher, but it was enough to break up the no-hitter.</p>

  <p>The announcers were stunned.</p>

  <p><q>That’s a bunt with two outs in the ninth to break up a no-hitter with an 11-0 lead,</q> one of them said, practically in disbelief. <q>Unbelievable.</q></p>

  <p>The other chimed in, <q>In baseball, there’s an unwritten rule—you just don’t do that. You don’t bunt when a no-hitter’s on the line. Especially with an 11-0 lead. It’s considered disrespectful to the pitcher, to the game. That’s a direct challenge to everything the sport stands for.</q></p>

  <p>But Rawls wasn’t done. Standing at first base, he turned toward the Orcas’ dugout and shouted, <q>Orcs!</q></p>

  <p>The insult wasn’t lost on anyone. <q>Orcs?</q> one of the announcers said incredulously. <q>That’s a jab at the Orcas’ team name. ‘Orcs’—it’s not just an insult to their identity; it’s a way of calling them brutish, savage, without respect for the game. Rawls knew exactly what he was doing.</q></p>

  <p>The Orcas dugout erupted in fury. Players jumped to their feet, shouting at Rawls, and within moments, the field was engulfed in a full-blown brawl. The camera caught glimpses of angry faces and players trying to restrain each other as the tension boiled over.</p>

  <p>Jim could feel the energy shift in the room as he and Tim watched the chaos unfold. It wasn’t just about the game anymore—it was about pride, and Rawls had poked the bear.</p>

  <p>When the dust finally settled, the game continued. The Orcas’ pitcher regained his composure, finishing out the game and securing the win with a final out. Despite the fight, the Orcas had come out on top, 11-0. The no-hitter had been broken up, but the real victory was in the scoreboard, not the statistics.</p>

  <p>Jim leaned back in his chair, still processing what had just happened. This game would be talked about for a long time—not for the final score, but for the moment Rawls had crossed the line, turning a clean victory into something far more complicated.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 2: The Fallout</h2>

  <p>The game had ended, the Orcas securing an 11-0 victory, but the real story was just beginning. Gunner Rawls had broken up the no-hitter with a bunt single in the ninth inning, a move that ignited a firestorm of controversy. As the final out was recorded, the stadium buzzed with disbelief and anger.</p>

  <p>In the locker room, the Orcas were seething. Their manager, a seasoned veteran of the game, paced back and forth, trying to maintain some semblance of order. <q>That was a cheap shot,</q> he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. <q>We don't play like that.</q></p>

  <p>The players nodded in agreement, their faces a mix of frustration and disbelief. Rawls had always been a thorn in their side, but this was different. This was a blatant disregard for the unwritten rules of the game.</p>

  <p>Outside the locker room, reporters gathered, eager to get a statement from the team's manager.</p>

  <p>The press conference was tense. The manager stood at the podium, his jaw clenched, as he addressed the media. <q>We don't condone what Rawls did,</q> he said firmly. <q>It's not how we play the game. It's not how baseball is meant to be played.</q></p>

  <p>The reporters fired off questions, but the manager remained composed, refusing to let Rawls' actions overshadow the team's victory. <q>We won the game,</q> he reiterated. <q>That's what matters.</q></p>

  <p>As the press conference concluded, Jim sat back in his chair, his mind racing. Rawls had crossed a line, and the fallout was far from over.</p>

  <p>Then came the news.</p>

  <p>A breaking news alert flashed across the screen: <strong>"Gunner Rawls found dead in the locker room. Authorities investigating."</strong></p>

  <p>Jim's heart sank. Rawls had been a polarizing figure, but no one deserved this. The game, the rivalry, it all seemed so trivial now.</p>

  <p>Just then, the phone rang.</p>

  <p><q>Jim, it's Mark. There's been a murder at the stadium—Gunner Rawls is dead. I need you at the scene.</q></p>

  <p><q>Understood. I'm on my way,</q> Jim replied, already grabbing his jacket.</p>

  <p>He turned to his son, Tim, who was still engrossed in the post-game analysis.</p>

  <p><q>Tim, I have to head out. Something's come up at the stadium. Stay here, and don't open the door for anyone. I'll be back soon.</q></p>

  <p>Tim looked up, concern flickering in his eyes. <q>Is everything okay?</q></p>

  <p><q>Just some post-game issues. Nothing for you to worry about,</q> Jim assured him before stepping out.</p>
