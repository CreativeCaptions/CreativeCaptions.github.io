  <h2>Chapter 1: The Cheap Bunt</h2>

  <p>The sound of the television was the only sound in the living room, save for the occasional clink of ice in Jim’s glass. Jim, the father, was comfortably settled in his favorite chair, eyes fixed on the screen as the Orange County Orcas battled the Texas Outriders.</p>

  <p>Lisa, his wife, popped her head into the living room with a grin. “We’ll be back in a bit. Don’t wait up.”</p>

  <p>Jim waved them off with a smile. “Go have fun, you two.”</p>

  <p>Lisa rolled her eyes good-naturedly and followed their daughter, Leigh, out the door. Jim and their son, Tim, were left to watch the final stretch of what was shaping up to be a memorable game.</p>

  <p>The Orcas pitcher had been perfect so far, retiring all 26 batters he’d faced. Now, with two outs in the ninth, he was just one away from a perfect game.</p>

  <p>Jim’s pulse quickened as he glanced over at Tim. They both knew this was a big deal—a no-hitter in the ninth. But with Gunner Rawls, the Outriders' volatile center fielder, coming up to bat with two outs, they could sense the drama wasn’t over yet.</p>

  <p>The announcers began discussing the tension. <q>We’re two outs into the ninth inning now, folks, and the Orcas pitcher is still perfect. One more out, and it’s a perfect game!</q></p>

  <p>Jim nodded, already anticipating what was to come. Rawls was arrogant, brash, and unpredictable. If anyone was going to break up a no-hitter, it was him. And then, the moment arrived, and Rawls stepped into the batter’s box. The camera zoomed in on him as he adjusted his gloves, an impassive look on his face.</p>

  <p>Jim’s eyes narrowed as Rawls took his stance. With two outs in the ninth, it was his last chance to make an impact on the game. The crowd was already on edge. Then, in a move that shocked everyone, Rawls laid down a bunt. It was weak, barely rolling past the pitcher, but it was enough to break up the no-hitter.</p>

  <p>The announcers were stunned.</p>

  <p><q>That’s a bunt with two outs in the ninth to break up a no-hitter with an 11-0 lead,</q> one of them said, practically in disbelief. <q>Unbelievable.</q></p>

  <p>The other chimed in, <q>In baseball, there’s an unwritten rule—you just don’t do that. You don’t bunt when a no-hitter’s on the line. Especially with an 11-0 lead. It’s considered disrespectful to the pitcher, to the game. That’s a direct challenge to everything the sport stands for.</q></p>

  <p>But Rawls wasn’t done. Standing at first base, he turned toward the Orcas’ dugout and shouted, <q>Orcs!</q></p>

  <p>The insult wasn’t lost on anyone. <q>Orcs?</q> one of the announcers said incredulously. <q>That’s a jab at the Orcas’ team name. ‘Orcs’—it’s not just an insult to their identity; it’s a way of calling them brutish, savage, without respect for the game. Rawls knew exactly what he was doing.</q></p>

  <p>The Orcas dugout erupted in fury. Players jumped to their feet, shouting at Rawls, and within moments, the field was engulfed in a full-blown brawl. The camera caught glimpses of angry faces and players trying to restrain each other as the tension boiled over.</p>

  <p>Jim could feel the energy shift in the room as he and Tim watched the chaos unfold. It wasn’t just about the game anymore—it was about pride, and Rawls had poked the bear.</p>

  <p>When the dust finally settled, the game continued. The Orcas’ pitcher regained his composure, finishing out the game and securing the win with a final out. Despite the fight, the Orcas had come out on top, 11-0. The no-hitter had been broken up, but the real victory was in the scoreboard, not the statistics.</p>

  <p>Jim leaned back in his chair, still processing what had just happened. This game would be talked about for a long time—not for the final score, but for the moment Rawls had crossed the line, turning a clean victory into something far more complicated.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 2: The Fallout</h2>

  <p>The game had ended, the Orcas securing an 11-0 victory, but the real story was just beginning. Gunner Rawls had broken up the no-hitter with a bunt single in the ninth inning, a move that ignited a firestorm of controversy. As the final out was recorded, the stadium buzzed with disbelief and anger.</p>

  <p>In the locker room, the Orcas were seething. Their manager, a seasoned veteran of the game, paced back and forth, trying to maintain some semblance of order. <q>That was a cheap shot,</q> he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. <q>We don't play like that.</q></p>

  <p>The players nodded in agreement, their faces a mix of frustration and disbelief. Rawls had always been a thorn in their side, but this was different. This was a blatant disregard for the unwritten rules of the game.</p>

  <p>Outside the locker room, reporters gathered, eager to get a statement from the team's manager.</p>

  <p>The press conference was tense. The manager stood at the podium, his jaw clenched, as he addressed the media. <q>We don't condone what Rawls did,</q> he said firmly. <q>It's not how we play the game. It's not how baseball is meant to be played.</q></p>

  <p>The reporters fired off questions, but the manager remained composed, refusing to let Rawls' actions overshadow the team's victory. <q>We won the game,</q> he reiterated. <q>That's what matters.</q></p>

  <p>As the press conference concluded, Jim sat back in his chair, his mind racing. Rawls had crossed a line, and the fallout was far from over.</p>

  <p>Then came the news.</p>

  <p>A breaking news alert flashed across the screen: <strong>"Gunner Rawls found dead in the locker room. Authorities investigating."</strong></p>

  <p>Jim's heart sank. Rawls had been a polarizing figure, but no one deserved this. The game, the rivalry, it all seemed so trivial now.</p>

  <p>Just then, the phone rang.</p>

  <p><q>Jim, it's Mark. There's been a murder at the stadium—Gunner Rawls is dead. I need you at the scene.</q></p>

  <p><q>Understood. I'm on my way,</q> Jim replied, already grabbing his jacket.</p>

  <p>He turned to his son, Tim, who was still engrossed in the post-game analysis.</p>

  <p><q>Tim, I have to head out. Something's come up at the stadium. Stay here, and don't open the door for anyone. I'll be back soon.</q></p>

  <p>Tim looked up, concern flickering in his eyes. <q>Is everything okay?</q></p>

  <p><q>Just some post-game issues. Nothing for you to worry about,</q> Jim assured him before stepping out.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3: The Investigation Begins</h2>

  <p>The drive to the stadium was swift, the streets relatively empty at this hour. Upon arrival, the area was cordoned off with police tape, and the flashing lights of patrol cars illuminated the night.</p>

  <p>Approaching the perimeter, Jim was stopped by a uniformed officer.</p>

  <p><q>I'm Jim Shore, Consultant with the Orange County Sheriff's Department,</q> he stated, presenting his credentials. <q>Detective Mark Reynolds is expecting me.</q></p>

  <p>The officer nodded, lifting the tape to allow Jim entry.</p>

  <p>Inside, the atmosphere was tense. Officers moved purposefully, gathering evidence and documenting the scene. Jim spotted Mark near the locker room entrance. The locker room buzzed with activity—flashing cameras, murmured conversations, and the rustle of evidence bags. Jim Shore stood at the threshold, taking in the scene with a practiced eye.</p>

  <p>Standing at six feet and weighing around 200 pounds, Jim's sandy blonde hair was neatly combed back, revealing piercing blue eyes that missed little. Clean-shaven and dressed in jeans, a button-up shirt, and a windbreaker, his demeanor exuded both authority and approachability.</p>

  <p>Detective Mark Reynolds approached, his presence commanding attention. Slightly taller than Jim, Mark's dark brown hair was neatly styled, complementing his deep-set hazel eyes that seemed to analyze everything they observed. Clad in a charcoal gray suit, his tie slightly loosened, Mark embodied the seasoned detective—methodical, relentless, and deeply intuitive.</p>

  <p><q>Jim, glad you’re here,</q> Mark said, gripping his hand in a firm shake. <q>It’s a mess—Rawls was found dead in the locker room. We’re treating it as a homicide. Did you bring your high-tech magnifying glass? You know, the one that talks back—EDA?</q></p>

  <p>Jim held up the EDA device. <q>Yep. Charged, calibrated, and only slightly judgmental.</q></p>

  <p>Mark smirked. <q>Perfect. Just what we need—a detective and a sassbot.</q></p>

  <p>Jim’s eyes shifted to the covered body in the center of the room. <q>Let’s see what we have here.</q></p>

  <p>Mark led him closer, lifting the edge of the sheet to reveal Gunner Rawls's lifeless face. The once-vibrant athlete now lay still, his expression frozen in surprise.</p>

  <p><q>Time of death is estimated between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m.,</q> Mark said. <q>Preliminary cause appears to be blunt force trauma to the back of the head.</q></p>

  <p>Jim took a photo of the blood and the wound where Rawls had been hit, storing it in EDA’s memory for later comparison.</p>

  <p>He nodded, scanning the room. <q>Any witnesses?</q></p>

  <p><q>Not yet. Custodial staff found him during their routine cleaning. We're reviewing security footage and interviewing team members.</q></p>

  <p>Jim's eyes settled on a nearby locker, its door slightly ajar. Inside, a baseball bat rested at an odd angle, its handle smeared with what appeared to be blood.</p>

  <p><q>Has this been processed?</q> he asked, pointing to the bat.</p>

  <p><q>Just about to. Could be our murder weapon.</q></p>

  <p>Jim took a photo of the blood on the bat.</p>

  <p><q>EDA, compare this blood sample on the bat to the one from Rawls’ head.</q></p>

  <p>EDA replied, <q>Spectral signature, viscosity pattern, and clotting rate match within 98.7% confidence. Likely same source.</q></p>

  <p>Jim raised an eyebrow. <q>That’s what I needed.</q></p>

  <p>Jim stepped back, his mind piecing together the fragments. The stadium, the timing, the victim—each element a thread in a complex tapestry.</p>

  <p><q>We'll need to delve into Rawls' relationships—teammates, rivals, anyone with a motive,</q> Jim mused.</p>

  <p>Mark nodded in agreement. <q>Agreed. Let's start compiling a list.</q></p>

  <p>As they moved to a quieter corner to strategize, the weight of the investigation settled over them. The game was over, but the real challenge had just begun.</p>
</section>

<section id="chapter4">
  <h2>Chapter 4: The Tunnel View</h2>

  <p>The stadium, once filled with cheers and conflict, now echoed with the sterile sounds of a crime scene. The locker room had been sealed off, but the hallway just beyond remained a flurry of quiet tension. Officers spoke in low tones, clipboards in hand, their shadows stretching long under the fluorescent lights.</p>

  <p>Jim stood outside the locker room, taking in the atmosphere. Mark approached.</p>

  <p><em>“Let’s get to work,”</em> he said.</p>

  <p><em>“Is the footage on its way?”</em> Jim asked.</p>

  <p>Mark gestured toward the hallway monitors. <em>“Already being reviewed. There are gaps, though. Cameras inside the locker rooms? Still off-limits—union rules. Closest we’ve got is from the tunnel entrance.”</em></p>

  <p>Jim raised an eyebrow. <em>“Convenient.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark gave a half-smile. <em>“Yeah. And a PR nightmare waiting to happen.”</em></p>

  <p>They walked slowly down the hallway, glancing at locker doors, security panels, and scuff marks on the concrete floor. Jim paused near a bench.</p>

  <p><em>“This area,”</em> he said, pointing to a cluster of vending machines across from the visitor locker room. <em>“Wide view. Could’ve been a good vantage point. Anyone loitering here would’ve seen who came and went.”</em></p>

  <p><em>“We’ll pull logs from nearby security card readers too,”</em> Mark said, taking a note. <em>“Though so far, nothing unusual’s popped.”</em></p>

  <p>They continued their sweep. At the end of the hallway, a janitor was giving a statement to a patrol officer, gesturing nervously toward the locker room.</p>

  <p>Jim approached gently. <em>“Mind if we ask a few follow-ups?”</em></p>

  <p>The janitor—late 40s, weary-eyed—nodded. <em>“Sure. I just handle maintenance here. Wasn’t expecting any of this.”</em></p>

  <p><em>“What time did you find the body?”</em> Jim asked.</p>

  <p><em>“A little after ten-fifteen. I’d just finished up the west corridor. I opened the door and saw him on the ground. I thought he’d passed out or something.”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Did you see anyone else nearby?”</em></p>

  <p>The man hesitated. <em>“There was someone leaving right before I got there. Maybe a player. Hoodie pulled up. Couldn’t see much.”</em></p>

  <p>Jim and Mark exchanged a look.</p>

  <p><em>“Did they say anything?”</em></p>

  <p>The janitor shook his head. <em>“Just walked past fast. No eye contact. Looked tense—might’ve just been post-game stress.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark scribbled in his notepad. <em>“Thanks. That helps.”</em></p>

  <p>As the janitor moved on, Jim stared back toward the locker room door.</p>

  <p><em>“One shadow,”</em> he murmured. <em>“Could be nothing. Could be everything.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark nodded. <em>“Either way, we’re not in the dugout anymore.”</em></p>
</section>

    <section id="chapter5">
  <h2>Chapter 5: The Team Captain</h2>

  <p>The interview room inside the stadium’s administrative wing was quiet, save for the soft hum of the overhead light. Jim sat across from Cole Hastings, the Orcas’ team captain and veteran first baseman. He had a reputation as a stand-up guy—respected by teammates, fans, even rivals. But tonight, respect wasn’t enough to keep him off the list of potential suspects.</p>

  <p>Mark leaned against the wall, arms crossed, while Jim did the talking.</p>

  <p>Cole fidgeted in his seat, his hands clasped tightly in front of him. <em>“You seriously think someone from our team did this?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“We’re not accusing anyone,”</em> Jim said calmly. <em>“We’re just trying to understand what happened. You were one of the last to see Rawls alive.”</em></p>

  <p>Cole looked up, his eyes a mix of anger and disbelief. <em>“Yeah, I saw him. We all did. After that stunt he pulled, the whole team was heated. But murder? Come on.”</em></p>

  <p>Jim leaned forward slightly. <em>“Walk us through what happened after the game. Start from the final out.”</em></p>

  <p>Cole sighed. <em>“After we got the last guy out, the dugout exploded—half celebration, half fury. Rawls was smirking the whole time like he’d just pulled off the greatest prank of the century. A couple of guys shouted at him—nothing new. I went back to the locker room, changed, grabbed a protein shake, and headed out. Didn’t even see Rawls again.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark spoke for the first time. <em>“You left right after the game?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“About fifteen, twenty minutes after. Security had started clearing out the fans. Look, I hated what he did, but I didn’t hate him. He was a showboat. That’s not a crime.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark scribbled a note. <em>“Was anyone close to snapping?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Danny Vega maybe,”</em> Cole admitted. <em>“He’s young, emotional. He’d been working closely with our pitcher all season, helping him build toward this no-hitter. Rawls humiliated him. Humiliated us. Danny stormed out before I did.”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Where’d he go?”</em> Jim asked.</p>

  <p><em>“No clue. But if you’re looking for someone who took this personally… it’s probably him.”</em></p>

  <p>Jim nodded, thanking Cole and standing up. <em>“We’ll be in touch.”</em></p>

  <p>As they stepped out into the hallway, Mark glanced over. <em>“Danny Vega’s not on our cleared list. Want me to bring him in?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Yeah,”</em> Jim said. <em>“Let’s talk to the kid.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark paused. <em>“You think he did it?”</em></p>

  <p>Jim didn’t answer right away. <em>“I think Rawls made a career out of poking people in the chest and laughing. But sometimes… the wrong person pokes back.”</em></p>
</section>

    <section id="chapter6">
  <h2>Chapter 6 – The Player Agent</h2>

  <p>Mark and Jim stood just outside the visitors’ locker room when a deputy approached. <em>“Detective, there’s someone here asking to speak with you. Jack Money. Says he’s Rawls’ agent.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark sighed. <em>“Send him in.”</em></p>

  <p>Moments later, Jack Money strode in like he owned the building. Designer sunglasses still on. Suit too slick for a ballgame. He stopped just short of the locker room door, looking around like he was assessing property.</p>

  <p><em>“Detective Reynolds?”</em> he said. <em>“I’m Jack Money—most folks in the business call me Jack ‘More’ Money.”</em> He smiled like it was supposed to land better.</p>

  <p>Jim gave him a polite nod. <em>“That nickname says a lot.”</em></p>

  <p>Money ignored the jab. <em>“This is a tragedy. Rawls was a headcase, sure, but no one deserves this. I’m here to cooperate.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark pulled out his notepad. <em>“When did you last speak with Rawls?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Earlier this evening. After the game. We argued. He fired me.”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Fired you?”</em> Jim said, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p><em>“Yeah. Told me I was holding him back. That he didn’t care about brand value or endorsements. Said he was ‘free.’ Like he was trying to reinvent himself.”</em></p>

  <p>Jim glanced at Mark. <em>“Was there bad blood before tonight?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Rawls was… difficult,”</em> Money said carefully. <em>“But tonight was different. He embarrassed himself. That bunt? It was suicide for his image.”</em></p>

  <p><em>“Did you threaten him?”</em> Mark asked.</p>

  <p>Money gave a slow blink. <em>“No. I told him I was out. And I left. If you check the parking lot cams, you’ll see my car pulling out. I made a call. Time-stamped. You’ll get it.”</em></p>

  <p>Mark didn’t say anything for a moment. Then: <em>“We will. Thanks for your time.”</em></p>

  <p>As Money turned and strutted off, Jim shook his head. <em>“That guy’s got snake oil in his veins.”</em></p>

  <p>Reynolds hesitated. <em>“You think Money did it?”</em></p>

  <p><em>“I think he had motive, timing, and a reason to disappear,”</em> Jim said. <em>“And if Rawls really fired him minutes before he ended up dead, that’s not just a red flag—that’s a red carpet.”</em></p>
