    <h2>Prayer for Those Who Have Accepted Jesus (Yeshua) and Seek to Follow God’s Guidance</h2>

    <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p>

    <p>Thank You for the gift of salvation through Jesus (Yeshua) Christ. I lift up those who have received Your grace and accepted Yeshua as their Savior. I ask that You strengthen them with Your guidance and lead them by the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh). Help them to live in a way that honors You, seeking to follow Your will without the need for correction. Empower them to embrace Your discipline as an opportunity to grow, and may their hearts remain open to Your conviction.</p>

    <p>Transform their desires, Father (Avinu), that they may reflect Your purpose.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Give them spiritual eyes to see life as You do and a mind that hungers for Your Word.</li>
        <li>Surround them with fellowship and accountability, so they are encouraged and supported in their walk with You.</li>
        <li>Guide them toward maturity, and may their decisions always reflect Your truth.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>May they live each day more fully surrendered to You, trusting in Your guidance and growing in the grace You’ve given them.</p>

    <p><strong>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</strong></p>
