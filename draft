  <h1>Why the Angels Should Draft Aiva Arquette — and Not Wait for 2028</h1>
  <p>The Angels don’t need another rebuild. They need a reset—with a plan. That’s why a polished college hitter like Aiva Arquette, who could debut by 2026, is more valuable to the Angels right now than gambling on a high schooler or even a fragile “#2 starter of the future.”</p>

  <h2>This Isn’t About Flash — It’s About Fit</h2>
  <p>Arquette may not be a 40‑HR star, but neither was Garret Anderson—and he anchored the Angels’ lineup for a decade. He hit .300, sprayed doubles, and gave the club professional at‑bats every night. Arquette’s ceiling is Anderson‑lite, with more modern polish and earlier power.</p>

  <h2>Pitching Isn’t Always Fixed With Pitchers</h2>
  <p>You want better pitching? Don’t just draft an arm—build the environment where pitchers succeed. That’s how the Tampa Bay Rays keep winning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Great defense = lower ERAs</li>
    <li>High‑contact offense = less pressure on starters</li>
    <li>Deep, flexible rosters = fewer breakdowns</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can turn a cheap #3 into a playoff‑caliber #2 if the team behind him works. Arquette brings the bat and glove to help make that happen.</p>

  <h2>This Is 1990 All Over Again</h2>
  <p>In 1990, two similar choices were in the MLB Draft: Garret Anderson or Alex Fernandez.</p>
  <h3>Garret Anderson (4th Round, 1990 MLB Draft – California Angels)</h3>
  <p>Garret Anderson enjoyed a steady and productive 17‑year MLB career, mostly with the Angels (1994–2008). A three‑time All‑Star and 2002 World Series champion, Anderson was known for his smooth left‑handed swing, consistent contact, and run production. He tallied over 2,500 hits, 522 doubles, and 287 home runs, earning a Silver Slugger in 2002. Though he rarely drew walks, his bat‑to‑ball skills and durability made him a key part of Anaheim's lineup for over a decade. Injuries, especially chronic arthritis in his back and legs, began to limit his playing time after 2004. He finished his career with brief stints with Atlanta and the Dodgers before retiring in 2010.</p>

  <h3>Alex Fernandez (1st Round, 1990 MLB Draft – Chicago White Sox)</h3>
  <p>Alex Fernandez had a promising career as a right‑handed starter, debuting in 1990 with the White Sox after being drafted fourth overall. He compiled a 107–87 record with a 3.74 ERA over 10 seasons with the White Sox and Marlins. Known for his command and toughness, Fernandez helped anchor Florida’s rotation during their 1997 World Series run. Unfortunately, a torn rotator cuff sidelined him during the postseason and derailed his career. He missed the entire 1998 season recovering from shoulder surgery and never fully regained form, retiring after 2000. Despite the shortened career, Fernandez left a mark as one of the better pitchers of the 1990s when healthy.</p>

  <h2>Then and Now</h2>
  <p>In 1990, owner Gene Autry was 83 years old. Today’s Angels face a similar choice:</p>
  <p><strong>Arte Moreno Is 78</strong></p>
  <p>He’s not waiting for a high school shortstop to mature in 2028. This franchise is running out of runway. So is Trout. So is fan patience.</p>
  <p>You don’t build around “maybe.” You build around players like Arquette who show up soon, elevate your current core, and quietly make your rotation better by existing.</p>

  <h2>Final Word</h2>
  <p>If you want better pitching, you don’t just draft it. You draft the bat who protects it. Arquette may not be flashy. But he’s ready when the Angels need him most—now.</p>
