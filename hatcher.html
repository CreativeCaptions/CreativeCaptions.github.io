  <h2>Who Was Right About Scoring Runs — Hatcher or Dipoto?</h2>

  <p>When the Angels fired hitting coach Mickey Hatcher in 2012, GM Jerry Dipoto believed a more analytical, modern approach would produce better results. More walks, more patience, more theory. But what actually happened?</p>

  <h3>The Hatcher Era (2000–Mid 2012)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Average Runs per Season: ~778</li>
    <li>Team Batting Average: Around .270</li>
    <li>OPS often above .740 — peaking at .825 in 2000</li>
    <li>Consistent offensive identity built around contact, aggression, and timely hitting</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Post-Hatcher Years (2013–2025)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Average Runs per Season: ~684</li>
    <li>Team Batting Average dropped to .230–.245 range</li>
    <li>Few seasons over 750 runs scored</li>
    <li>Occasional OBP gains did not translate into more runs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Score: Hatcher 1, Dipoto 0</h3>
  <p>Despite the criticism of Hatcher’s “old-school” style, the numbers speak for themselves. The Angels consistently hit better and scored more with Hatcher in the dugout.</p>

  <p>Modern analytics have their place, but when it comes to generating offense, Hatcher’s system produced results that Dipoto’s staff never replaced. A decade later, the team still hasn't recovered its offensive identity.</p>
