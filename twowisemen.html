    <p>Once upon a time in the land of Knowitallia, there lived two very wise men. At least, that’s what their business cards said.</p>

    <p>The first was Professor Pompous, who wore a hat so tall it needed its own postal code.</p>

    <p>The second was Doctor Dither, who spoke in five languages, none of them correctly.</p>

    <p>One day, they met in the town square and instantly disagreed about something extremely important:</p>

    <p><strong>Which end of a banana you’re supposed to peel first.</strong></p>

    <p>“Obviously, one peels from the top,” said Professor Pompous.</p>

    <p>“Utter nonsense!” said Doctor Dither. “The bottom is the beginning!”</p>

    <p>Soon, a crowd gathered to witness the battle of brilliance. They argued for hours. Charts were drawn. A small interpretive dance broke out. Someone brought a banana.</p>

    <p>Both men peeled it at the same time, from opposite ends—and the banana shot out like a rocket, hitting the mayor.</p>

    <p>The crowd gasped. The mayor sighed.</p>

    <p><em>“You two may be wise, but you’re not very bright.”</em></p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Moral of the Story:</h3>
    <p><strong>Two wrongs don’t make a right.<br>
    But they will make a banana split.</strong></p>
