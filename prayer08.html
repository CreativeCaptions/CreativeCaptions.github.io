        A Prayer for Jewish Followers of Yeshua, for Israel, and for the Peace of Jerusalem
      </h1>
    </header>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <section>
      <p>Heavenly Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</p>
      <p>We come before You with humility and reverence, acknowledging that You are faithful to Your promises, and that Your word never returns void.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Jewish Followers of Yeshua -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 2em;">
        For Jewish Followers of Yeshua (Jesus)
      </h2>
      <p>Lord God,</p>
      <p>We thank You for our Jewish brothers and sisters who have recognized Yeshua as the Messiah, the Holy and Righteous One proclaimed by the prophets.</p>
      <p>Strengthen them in faith, courage, and wisdom. Protect them from isolation, fear, and persecution. Let them stand firmly in the truth, just as Peter declared at Pentecost that Yeshua is both Lord and Messiah.</p>
      <p>May their lives be a living testimony that the promises given to Israel find their fulfillment in Christ.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Israel -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 2em;">
        For Israel
      </h2>
      <p>Faithful God,</p>
      <p>You chose Israel not because of greatness, but because of Your covenant love.</p>
      <p>As Paul taught, <q>the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</q></p>
      <p>We pray for Israel’s leaders, defenders, and citizens. Grant wisdom where there is confusion, restraint where there is anger, and justice where there is suffering.</p>
      <p>Watch over Israel day and night, for You neither sleep nor slumber, and Your protection never fails.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Peace of Jerusalem -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 2em;">
        For the Peace of Jerusalem
      </h2>
      <p>Lord of Peace,</p>
      <p>We obey Your word and pray for Jerusalem, as You have commanded:</p>
      <blockquote style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic; color: #333;">
        <p>“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May those who love you be secure.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Bring peace that is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of righteousness, truth, and mercy. Let peace flow through the city as living water from Your throne.</p>

    <!-- Gospel Preached by Peter and Paul -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 2em;">
        According to the Gospel Preached by Peter and Paul
      </h2>
      <p>Father,</p>
      <p>As Peter preached repentance and restoration, and as Paul proclaimed salvation by grace through faith, we ask that many may turn to You — Jew and Gentile alike — not by the works of the Law, but by faith in the One who fulfilled the Law and bore our sins on the cross.</p>
      <p>Let Your mercy triumph over judgment.</p>
      <p>Let truth overcome deception.</p>
      <p>Let light drive out darkness.</p>

        Closing
      </h2>
      <p>We trust You, Lord, with Israel, with Jerusalem, and with all who call upon the name of Yeshua.</p>
      <p>May Your kingdom come.</p>
      <p>May Your will be done.</p>
      <p>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</p>
