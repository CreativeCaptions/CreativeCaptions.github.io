        <h1>Personalized Prayer for Others to Come to Salvation</h1>
        
        <p class="prayer-text">
            Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),<br><br>

            I come before You, lifting up those who have not yet come to know the saving grace of Your Son, Jesus (Yeshua) Christ. I ask for Your mercy and compassion upon them, that they may come to recognize the truth of Your love and the power of the cross. Open their hearts and minds to receive the gift of salvation that You freely offer through Jesus (Yeshua).<br><br>

            Father, I pray that Your Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh) would convict them of their need for a Savior and draw them closer to You. Help them to see the depth of Your love and to understand the sacrifice Jesus made on their behalf. Remove any barriers in their hearts and minds that prevent them from accepting Your invitation to eternal life.<br><br>

            I ask that You place people in their lives who will share the gospel with them, and that You would soften their hearts to receive the truth. May they come to the realization that salvation is not by works, but through faith in Jesus (Yeshua) alone. I pray for their salvation and for their lives to be transformed by Your grace.<br><br>

            Lord, I trust that You desire all to come to know You and be saved. I commit these souls into Your hands, believing that You are able to bring them into Your kingdom. May they experience the joy and peace that comes from knowing You as their Lord and Savior.<br><br>

            In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.<br><br>
