        <h2> Prayer for a Child’s Protection and Spiritual Formation in the Womb </h2>  

        <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p>  

        <p> Giver of life and the One who knits us together in the womb, I come before You with a heart full of gratitude and trust. I lift up this precious child You are forming, and I dedicate them to You even now, before they take their first breath.  </p>  

  

<p> Giver of life and the One who knits us together in the womb, I come before You with a heart full of gratitude and trust. I lift up this precious child You are forming, and I dedicate them to You even now, before they take their first breath. </p>  

<p> Lord, I ask for Your divine protection over their development. As You carefully fashion their body, organs, and mind, I pray that every part will grow according to Your perfect design. Guard them from any harm, injury, or complication—let their movements be safe, their growth be strong, and their health be whole. May the womb be a sanctuary of peace, free from anything that could hinder the work of Your hands. </p>  

<p> Father, I also bring before You this child’s spiritual formation. I know that all are born with a nature inclined toward sin, but I ask that even now, You set this child apart for righteousness. By the power of Your Spirit, begin shaping their heart to long for You, their mind to desire truth, and their soul to be attuned to Your presence. Let the prayers spoken over them now be a covering, drawing them into a life led by Your wisdom and grace. </p>  

<p> As You called Jeremiah before he was born, as You filled John the Baptist with Your Spirit even in the womb, I ask that this child be consecrated for Your purpose. May their destiny be sealed in You, and may they be protected not only in body but in heart and mind from the corruption of this world. </p>  

<p> Lord, I surrender this child into Your hands. You are the Potter, and they are the clay. Shape them according to Your will, shield them from harm, and lead them into a life that glorifies You. <p>  

 <p><strong>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</strong></p>
