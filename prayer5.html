        <h2> Prayer for a Child’s Protection and Spiritual Formation in the Womb </h2>  

        <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p>  

 <p> Giver of life and the One who knits us together in the womb, I come before You with a heart full of gratitude and trust. I lift up this precious child You are forming, and I dedicate them to You even now, before they take their first breath. </p>  

<p> Lord, I ask for Your divine protection over their development. As You carefully fashion their body, organs, and mind, I pray that every part will grow according to Your perfect design. Guard them from any harm, injury, or complication—let their movements be safe, their growth be strong, and their health be whole. May the womb be a sanctuary of peace, free from anything that could hinder the work of Your hands. </p>  

<p> Father, I also bring before You this child’s spiritual formation. I know that all are born with a nature inclined toward sin, but I ask that even now, You set this child apart for righteousness. By the power of Your Spirit, begin shaping their heart to long for You, their mind to desire truth, and their soul to be attuned to Your presence. Let the prayers spoken over them now be a covering, drawing them into a life led by Your wisdom and grace. </p>  

<p> May this child grow up with a heart that seeks You, a mind that loves Your truth, and a spirit that follows Jesus. Let their life be marked by faith, love, and a desire to walk in Your ways. Protect them not only in body but in heart and mind, guarding them from the influences of this world that would pull them away from You. </p>  

<p> Lord, I surrender this child into Your hands. You are the Potter, and they are the clay. Shape them according to Your will, shield them from harm, and lead them into a life that glorifies You. <p>  

 <p><strong>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</strong></p>
