    <p><strong>Heavenly Father (Avinu Shebashamayim),</strong></p>

    <p>
      We come before You acknowledging that we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,
      but against principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, and spiritual wickedness
      in high places. You alone are sovereign, and all authority belongs to You.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the name of Jesus (Yeshua) Christ, we ask that the works of darkness operating
      in this world be exposed and restrained by Your light. Where deception, fear,
      and division prevail, release truth, peace, and clarity by Your Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Father (Avinu),</strong> dismantle every scheme that exalts itself against
      the knowledge of God. Strengthen Your people to stand firm, clothed in the full
      Armor of God, unmoved by intimidation or despair. Let the victory of the cross
      silence accusation, and let the resurrection power of Jesus (Yeshua) Christ bring
      freedom to those held in bondage.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh),</strong> move across nations and hearts.
      Awaken consciences, turn hearts toward righteousness, and draw many from darkness
      into the light of Your truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      May Your Kingdom come and Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
    </p>

    <p>
      We trust not in human strength, but in You alone — our defender, our light,
      and our salvation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In Jesus’ (Yeshua’s) name, Amen.</strong>
    </p>
