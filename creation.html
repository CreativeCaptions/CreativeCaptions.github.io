   <h1>Creation, Fashioning, and the Beginning of Earthly Time</h1>

  <h2>1. The Original Creation (Genesis 1:1)</h2>
  <p><q>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</q></p>
  <p>The Hebrew word <em>bara</em> means “to create out of nothing.”</p>
  <p>This verse describes the original act of creation—when God brought matter, energy, and the elements of the universe into being.</p>
  <p>That act could have occurred eons ago, long before the Earth was made ready for life. The universe already existed, but the Earth at that stage was “without form and void” (Genesis 1:2)—unshaped, lifeless, and dark.</p>

  <h2>2. The Beginning of God’s Fashioning Work (Genesis 1:3–31)</h2>
  <p><q>And God said, ‘Let there be light.’</q></p>
  <p>This moment marks the start of order and measurable time on Earth.</p>
  <p>When God introduced light, He began the six literal, 24-hour days described in Genesis.</p>
  <p>Each “evening and morning” shows that these were normal days, not symbolic eras.</p>
  <p>During this period, God fashioned (<em>asah</em>) what He had already created (<em>bara</em>):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>separating light from darkness,</li>
    <li>forming the sky, sea, and land,</li>
    <li>bringing forth life,</li>
    <li>and finally, creating mankind in His image.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is when the Earth became habitable — when it was “fashioned” into the world we now know.</p>

  <h2>3. The Era of Humanity (Approx. 6,000 Years)</h2>
  <p>The formation of Adam and Eve marked the beginning of recorded human history, roughly six thousand years ago.</p>
  <p>Adam himself was made from “the dust of the ground” (Genesis 2:7)—dust composed of elements that God had created long before.</p>
  <p>Though Adam lived 930 years, he never reached a full “day” in God’s reckoning, for “a day is with the Lord as a thousand years” (2 Peter 3:8).</p>
  <p>This subtle detail illustrates that while God’s creation is ancient, humanity’s story is recent and confined within the framework of Earthly time.</p>

  <h2>4. The Harmony of the Two Views</h2>
  <p>The elements of the Earth and the starlight of the heavens can indeed be ancient—stretching back to the “beginning” when God first created all things.</p>
  <p>The fashioning of Earth and the creation of mankind occurred much later, within six literal days, starting when God said, “Let there be light.”</p>
  <p>Thus, Scripture and observation can stand together:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the universe bears witness to God’s eternal power and preparation,</li>
    <li>while the six-day fashioning reveals His personal attention to detail and His purpose in creating life.</li>
  </ul>
