<h2>Ouch! Ouch!</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, in the rolling hills of Thimblewick, there lived a quiet fellow named Barley Rock.</p>

<p>Barley loved nature. He especially loved his yard, which he tended with great care. He watered, he weeded, and he trimmed until the hedges looked almost polite.</p>

<p>Each morning, Barley would walk barefoot through the grass because he liked the feel of it between his toes.</p>

<p>He considered it a friendship of sorts.</p>

<p>But… Barley had a rocky relationship with his yard.</p>

<p>Being nearsighted, he’d step on a rock…</p>

<p>“Ouch! Ouch! That is a BIG rock!” he cried, hopping in circles.</p>

<p>Now, Barley’s neighbor, a neat and cheerful man named Thomley Fig, had a yard that was always green — too green, if you asked Barley.</p>

<p>One hot summer’s day, Barley began his daily routine of walking through his yard…</p>

<p>“Ouch! Ouch! That’s an even BIGGER rock!” he yelped.</p>

<p>Barley had had enough. He had to see what Thomley’s yard felt like.</p>

<p>He jumped the fence to feel that wondrous grass for himself…</p>

<p>“Ouch! Ooch! That hurts!” he cried, dancing backward on sore toes.</p>

<p>From then on, Barley wore shoes… and watered his polite hedges with a little more pride, because while the grass may always be greener on the other side, it might just be because it’s artificial.</p>
