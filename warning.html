<h2>Perry Minasian’s Trades as Angels GM: A Cause for Concern?</h2>

<p>Do we really want GM Perry Minasian trading away the few remaining assets the Angels have left—only to get back players who, more often than not, provide little to no value? While he’s made a few solid draft picks and one or two trade wins, most of his deals feel like wishful thinking—good only through rose-colored glasses. And the returns? Often players who are <em>AAAA</em> (too good for Triple-A, not good enough for the majors), or <em>overhyped</em> prospects who fade once the spotlight hits.</p>

<em>Verdict: “Good through rose-colored glasses”</em></p>

<p><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
With so few viable assets left, Perry Minasian’s tendency to make quantity-over-quality trades—where the return is too often a parade of fringe MLB talent—should raise concern. The Marsh-for-O’Hoppe deal was a rare win. Most others? <em>AAAA players</em>, <em>overhyped prospects</em>, or <em>expiring contracts dumped on waivers</em> weeks later.</p>

<p>If the Angels are going to rebuild properly—or even try to stay competitive—they can’t afford many more “rose-colored” deals.  Minasian needs to go before the Angels make any more deals.</p>
